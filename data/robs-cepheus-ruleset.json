The ablation of the material carries away the energy of the laser, and protects the Traveller. Continued fire against Ablat degrades its effectiveness, but\nthe armour is cheap and easily replaceable. Ablat also has a minimal value against other forms of attack but it cannot be combined with other types of armour. Each laser hit on ablat armour reduces its AR score by one."

The fabric absorbs impact energy, distributing the blow over the body of the target and usually resulting in bruising. Cloth armour can be concealed under clothing but is fairly easy to spot – a Routine (6+) Investigate or Recon check is all that is required to spot the armour. At TL12, a thin type of cloth armour becomes available that is light enough that it can be worn under other types of armour, adding its protection."
