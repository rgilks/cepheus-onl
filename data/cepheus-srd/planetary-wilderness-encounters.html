          <h1>Chapter 13: Planetary Wilderness Encounters</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            Characters in the uncivilized areas on the planet’s surface quickly find out that they
            are not alone. So long as a world can support life, animal encounters and other natural
            events are common, regardless of the current terrain. This chapter discusses various
            encounters that can occur in the wilderness on a planet’s surface.
          </p>

          <h2 id="animal-encounters">Animal Encounters</h2>
          <p>
            Animals in any ecological system interact with each other, forming food chains, obeying
            instincts, defending territory, and generally living out their lives. When people enter
            such an ecological system, they will encounter the animals of the system, prompting
            natural reactions, such as attack or flight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the precise nature of animals may change, and they may prove quite alien to
            ordinary experience, most will conform to the broad classifications given below. A
            Referee may choose to establish his own ecological system on a specific world, ignoring
            the encounter system outlined here. This system, however, is intended to allow broad
            latitude in both animal types and attack/defense mechanisms, while remaining essentially
            logical and reasonable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Animal Types:</b> Nearly all animals may be classified into four basic categories:
            herbivore, omnivore, carnivore, and scavenger. Specific definitions for these terms are
            provided in a later section of these rules, and differ from the precise scientific
            definitions in current use. Within each category, a variety of animal types exist, based
            on specific feeding/hunting habits; examples of this concept are grazers, chasers, and
            pouncers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Animals which are encountered may be further classified into various categories and
            types, and specific attack and defense mechanisms determined. The resulting description
            indicates the actions an animal will take without resorting to such confining labels as
            bear or tiger. While a Referee may well elect to use such names, this system also allows
            the players freedom to encounter truly alien beasts as well.
          </p>

          <h3 id="animals-and-characteristics">Animals and Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            Animals have a similar range of characteristics to humans, but there are several
            differences:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Instinct</dt>
            <dd>
              Instinct is the animal equivalent of Education. Animals apply their Instinct DM to
              tasks such as sensing prey or solving problems.
            </dd>
            <dt>Pack</dt>
            <dd>
              Pack is the animal equivalent of Social Standing. The higher a creature’s Pack score,
              the larger the group that it is associated with, and the more standing the creature
              has in that group.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h3 id="planetary-themes">Planetary Themes</h3>
          <p>
            A world's ecology can be extremely diverse. However, the Referee may elect to implement
            specific themes on a planetary basis, to create consistency and flavor in presentation.
            Distinctive features help make each world stand out to the players as unique
            experiences. These could range from basic symmetry to reproductive methods (and the
            associated genders), from the number of limb pairs to the common sensory organs. The
            implementation of a planetary theme lies at the discretion of the Referee.
          </p>

          <h3>Step One: Choose a Terrain</h3>
          <p>
            Terrain has an impact on the type of animals one might encounter. Giant aquatic
            creatures are not found in forests, after all, nor are feathered flying creatures found
            flying at the bottom of the ocean. The first step in the rules for creating animals in
            the Cepheus Engine is to choose the creature’s terrain, as terrain can have a
            significant impact on an animal’s statistics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Terrain DM Chart details modifiers for animal subtypes and sizes, In addition, the
            result of 1D6 determines the basic movement for a given creature (A for Amphibious, F
            for Flight, S for Swimming, and W for Walking). Some movement codes have a number after
            them; these are an additional Size DM for the animal.

          <h3>Step Two: Determine the Animal’s Type and Subtype</h3>
          <p>
            The Referee should then determine the animal’s type and subtype. If the Referee is
            building up an encounter table, the animal’s type is obvious: the type necessary to fill
            in this entry on the encounter table. Otherwise, the Referee must choose an appropriate
            type: Carnivore, Herbivore, Omnivore or Scavenger. The Referee might also roll on the
            1D6 Animal Encounter Table Template to randomly choose an animal type.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the animal type has been determined, the Referee rolls 2D6, and add in the
            terrain’s Subtype DM. After that, the Referee consults the Subtype by Animal Type table
            under the column of the animal’s type to determine the animal’s subtype.

          <h3>Step Three: Note Modifiers and Skills by Subtype</h3>
          <p>
            Terran creatures that exemplify these specific subtypes are noted in brackets after the
            name. The Referee should make note of the characteristic modifiers and skills that are
            noted after the description – the exact level of skills varies depending on the
            particular creature.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Carrion-Eater (vulture)</dt>

            <dd>
              Herbivores which pass their environment through their bodies are termed filters.
              Unlike grazers, which move to food, filters move a flow of matter through themselves

            <dt>Gatherer (raccoon, chimpanzee)</dt>
            <dd>

              Pouncers kill by stalking and ambushing their prey. Pouncers have Recon and Athletics.
              Dexterity +4, Instinct +4.
            </dd>
            <dt>Reducer (vermin)</dt>
            <dd>
              Reducers are scavengers that act constantly on all available food, devouring even the
              remains left by other scavengers. Pack +4
            </dd>
            <dt>Siren (venus fly-trap)</dt>
            <dd>
              Sirens create a lure to attract prey. Usually, this lure will be specific to the
              species the siren preys on, but some rare lures are universal. Pack –4.
            </dd>
            <dt>Trapper (spider)</dt>
            <dd>
              An animal which allows its prey to enter a trap. Generally, any creature surprised by
              a trapper is caught in its trap. Pack –2.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h3>Step Four: Determine Animal Size and Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            For each creature, roll 2D6 for its Size and apply any Size DMs based on terrain and
            movement. The creature’s Size determines its Weight, Strength, Dexterity and Endurance –
            for example, a roll of 7 means that the creature has a mass of 100kg, a Strength score
            of 3D6, a Dexterity score of 3D6 and an Endurance of 3D6.
          </p>
          <p>
            Intelligence for most animals is 0 or 1. Roll 2D6+DMs for the animal’s Instinct and
            Pack. To determine the number appearing value, consult the Number Appearing by Pack
            Characteristic Score table.
          </p>
          <p>
            All animals have at least
            <a href="skills.html#athletics">Athletics</a> 0,
            <a href="skills.html#recon">Recon</a> 0, and
            <a href="skills.html#survival">Survival</a> 0, and most will have 1D6 ranks split among
            these skills, <a href="skills.html#natural-weapons">Natural Weapons</a>, and any skills
            listed in their behavior.

          <h3>Step Five: Determine Animal’s Weapons, Armor and Base Speed</h3>
          <p>Roll 2D6 separately for the animal’s Weapons and Armor.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Weapons</dt>
            <dd>
              When generating weapons, roll 2D6 and consult the Animal Weapons table. Add a +8 DM if
              the animal is a Carnivore, and a +4 if it is an Omnivore; subtract a –6 DM if the
              animal is a Herbivore. Scavengers automatically have Teeth in addition to any other
              weapons. If a number is present after the Weapons type, then add that number to the
              number of damage dice the creature rolls. Damage from attacks depends on the
              creature’s Strength score, as shown in the Damage by Strength table.
            </dd>
            <dt>Armor</dt>
            <dd>
              When generating an animal’s armor, roll 2D6-7, and add the animal’s Size result (the
              die roll result that determined the animal’s size, not the actual weight of the
              animal.) Add a +4 DM when rolling for armor if the animal is a Herbivore, and a +2 if
              it is an Scavenger; apply a –2 DM if the animal is a Carnivore. Also, Flyers suffer a
              –2 DM when determining armor. Consult the Animal Armor table for the animal’s armor
              rating.
            </dd>
            <dt>Base Speed</dt>
            <dd>
              An animal’s base speed is determined by generating a Speed Multiplier, as per the
              Animal Speed Multiplier by Subtype table, and multiplying that by 6, which is the
              average speed of a human in meters per minor action. If an Animal Speed Multiplier
              value falls below the value found in the Minimum Speed column, round it up to the
              Minimum Speed value.

          <h2 id="creating-encounter-tables">Creating Encounter Tables</h2>
          <p>
            The system for creating animals in the Cepheus Engine rules can be used to generate
            creatures on the fly. However, the system works best when the Referee prepares an
            encounter table for each terrain likely to be encountered. This not only gives the
            Referee statistics for wilderness adventuring, but also provided a large amount of
            potential background data for expanding the world within the universe the Referee has
            created.
          </p>
          <p>
            To create an encounter table, first the Referee should select a table format. Although
            an encounter table can be in whatever format the Referee desires, the two formats most
            commonly used are represented in these rules as the 1D6 Animal Encounter Table Template
            and the 2D6 Animal Encounter Table Template. Note that the Templates only provide an
            animal's type (carnivore, herbivore, omnivore or scavenger), and in the case of the 2D6
            table, event.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each entry should be generated in turn. When an encounter table indicates that an event
            will occur, the Referee should create an event appropriate to the world and terrain. An
            event may be almost anything, including a natural disaster or seismic event, an
            interesting terrain feature or curiosity, unusual flora or weather. The Hills Terrain
            Encounter Table is an example of a completed encounter table.

          <h2 id="using-encounter-tables">Using the Encounter Tables</h2>
          <p>
            Each day an adventuring band may possibly have one or more encounters with some animal
            life forms. As a general rule, the Referee will check for an encounter once while the
            band is travelling and once while the band is halted (for rest, exercise, encampment, or
            whatever). There is a one-third chance (5+ on 1D6) that an animal encounter will occur
            in any of the specified terrain types. The Referee may choose to modify this frequency
            depending on planetary or local conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, specific encounters at specific locations are always possible. For example,
            the Referee may already have populated a location (perhaps a ruin) with specific
            animals. These are not subject to normal random encounter rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            By their lifeless nature, vacuum worlds (and any other world without life) tend to have
            encounter tables comprised primarily of events. On an airless world, events could
            include silt pools that operate like quicksand, magnetic anomalies, solar flares, or
            possibly tracks left by previous explorers.
