            This section describes some of the watercraft that can be commonly encountered in
            Cepheus Engine campaigns. These are not the only types of vessels that exist, and
            creative Referees are encouraged to integrate vehicles of their own creation or from
            other sources as they see fit.
          </p>

          <h2>TL9 Destroyer</h2>
          <p>
            Using a closed 800-ton chassis (160 Hull, 160 Structure [Personal Combat Scale], 16
            Hull, 16 Structure [Space Combat Scale], Armor 6), the Destroyer is a fast, maneuverable
            long-endurance watercraft built for military action, intended to escort larger
            watercraft in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against smaller powerful
            short-range attackers. It carries an Early Fusion power plant, Code K, and a Screw
            Propeller propulsion system, Code K, giving a top speed of 60kph, a cruising speed of
            45kph and an Agility DM of -3. 496 kiloliters of hydrogen support the power plant for 28
            days. This vehicle is designed with an increased Agility, already included in the
            Agility DM above. This vehicle is equipped with Advanced controls, a Class IV
            communication system (Continental), Basic Civilian sensors (DM -2), and a Model/1fib
            computer. This vessel is equipped with Autopilot (Ocean Ships-2). There is an extended
            control cabin that supports 30 crew on shift), and 29 standard staterooms. The vehicle
            has 160 weapon points, but only 23 are used. The vehicle has four small turrets armed
            with Autocannon-TL 8, one small turret armed with a Heavy Mass Driver-TL 8, eight small
            turrets armed with Heavy Rocket Artillery-TL 7, four missile racks (armed with Smart
            Standard HE missiles), and two HE torpedo ordinance bays (3 torpedoes each). This
            vehicle also carries 1800 rounds of Autocannon ammunition, 300 rounds of Heavy Mass
            Driver ammunition, 900 rounds of Heavy Rocket Artillery ammunition, 900 Smart Standard
            HE missiles, and 240 Standard HE torpedoes. Cargo capacity is 70.615 tons. The chassis
            is additionally armored with Titanium Steel (x2.) The vehicle requires a crew of 28: 1
            Captain, 1 Executive Officer, 3 Pilots, 1 Navigator, 1 Engineer, 1 Sensors Operator, 17
            Turret Gunners, 2 Bay Weapon Gunners, and 1 Chief Security Officer. The vehicle can
            carry up to forty additional passengers in twenty standard staterooms, or forty-two if
            both the Captain and Executive Officer share a stateroom. The vehicle costs
            KCr51,521.940 (including discounts and fees) and takes 92 weeks to build.

          <h2>TL7 Hovercraft</h2>
          <p>
            Using a closed eight-ton chassis (1 Hull, 2 Structure, Armor 3), the Hovercraft is a
            ground effect vehicle supported on a cushion of air roughly two meters high, with the
            ability to move about on both water and land, so long as travel conditions and surfaces
            are not irregular, turbulent or rough. It carries a Gas Turbine engine, Code L, and an
            Air Cushion propulsion system, Code L, giving a top speed of 100kph, a cruising speed of
            75kph and an Agility DM of +1. 430 liters of hydrocarbons support the power plant for 16
            hours. This vehicle is equipped with Basic controls and a Class III communication system
            (Regional). There is a basic cockpit and 15 cramped chairs. The vehicle also has a
            fresher installed. Cargo capacity is 4.35 tons. The vehicle requires a crew of one: the
            pilot. The vehicle can carry up to fifteen additional passengers in cramped seating. The
            vehicle costs KCr144.660 (including discounts and fees) and takes 36 hours to build.

          <h2>TL5 Motor Boat</h2>
          <p>
            Using a closed 60-ton chassis (12 Hull, 12 Structure [Personal Combat Scale], 1 Hull, 1
            Structure [Space Combat Scale], Armor 2), the Motor Boat is a watercraft designed to
            transport a limited amount of passengers and cargo from point to point over small bodies
            of water. The vehicle is streamlined. It carries an Internal Combustion engine, Code sC,
            and a Screw Propeller propulsion system, Code sC, giving a top speed of 100kph, a
            cruising speed of 75kph and an Agility DM of -2. 1.29 kiloliters of hydrocarbons support
            the power plant for 10 hours. This vehicle is equipped with Basic controls, and a Class
            II communication system (Very Distant). There are a standard control cabin and five
            standard staterooms. Cargo capacity is 22.74 tons. The vehicle requires a crew of two:
            one Pilot and one Engineer. The vehicle can carry up to eight additional passengers in
            four standard staterooms. The vehicle costs KCr2,698.450 (including discounts and fees)
            and takes 32 weeks to build.
