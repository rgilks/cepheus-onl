          <h2 id="star-mapping">Star Mapping</h2>
          <p>
            For Cepheus Engine universes, the presence of star systems is marked on hex maps, each
            hex representing one parsec. For each system, generate a Universal World Profile for the
            primary world of the system. The smallest astrogation map size, the subsector, measures
            8 hexes wide by 10 hexes high. An intermediate map size, the quadrant, measures two
            subsectors by two subsectors, while the largest map size, the sector, measures two
            quadrants by two quadrants.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a basic one-half chance normally that a world (and its attendant stellar
            system) will be in a hex. Systematically check each hex on the subsector map, throwing
            one die and marking the hex with a circle if the result is a 4, 5, or 6. This indicates
            that a world is present; otherwise, leave the hex blank. The Referee may elect to alter
            the normal chances of worlds, making them more frequent or less frequent to correspond
            to specific regions of the galaxy. A 50% density (no DM) is appropriate for the spiral
            arms of the galaxy. Apply a –2 DM for 'rift sectors', a –1 DM for sparse sectors and a
            +1 DM for densely populated sectors.
          </p>

          <h2 id="world-size">World Size</h2>
          <p>
            The Size characteristic for inhabitable worlds ranges from 0 to 10, and is determined by

          <h3 id="high-and-low-gravity-worlds">High and Low Gravity Worlds</h3>
          <p>
            Worlds where the gravity is 0.75 or less are low-gravity worlds. Common features include
            improbable-looking rock formations, thin and spindly life forms and flying as a common
            form of locomotion (assuming the atmosphere is thick enough to support flyers). Humans
            tend to find life on low-gravity worlds to be initially pleasant, but regular exercise
            regimes and medicinal supplements are required to prevent bone and muscle degradation.
            Those who spent too long on low-gravity worlds cannot tolerate higher gravities.
            Characters on low-gravity worlds suffer a –1 DM to all skill checks until they
            acclimatize, a process which takes 1D6 weeks. Characters with the Zero-G skill at level
            0 or better acclimatize instantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            High-gravity worlds have a gravity 1.25 times or more than of Earth. They tend to be
            extremely dense worlds; common features include wide rocky plains, squat, muscular
            creatures, and plant life that spreads out like lichen instead of growing up. Crawling,
            burrowing or swimming are the commonest forms of locomotion. Humans find high-gravity
            worlds unpleasant. Especially high-gravity worlds require the use of pressured or
            powered suits to support the human frame. Characters on high-gravity worlds suffer a –1
            DM to all skill checks until they acclimatize, a process which takes 1D6 weeks.

            world's Size equals 0, then the world's Atmosphere equals 0. The Atmosphere code should
            never be higher than 15(F).

            <dt>Tainted</dt>
            <dd>
              Tainted atmospheres contain some element that is harmful to humans, such as an
              unusually high proportion of carbon dioxide. A character who breathes a tainted
              atmosphere without a filter will suffer 1D6 damage every few minutes (or hours,
              depending on the level of taint).
            </dd>
            <dt>Exotic</dt>
            <dd>
              An exotic atmosphere is unbreathable by humans, but is not otherwise hazardous. A
              character needs an air supply to breath in an exotic atmosphere.
            </dd>
            <dt>Corrosive</dt>
            <dd>
              Corrosive atmospheres are highly dangerous. A character who breathes in a corrosive
              atmosphere will suffer 1D6 damage each round.
            </dd>
            <dt>Insidious</dt>
            <dd>
              An insidious atmosphere is like a corrosive one, but it is so corrosive that it
              attacks equipment as well. The chief danger in an insidious atmosphere is that the
              toxic gases will destroy the seals and filters on the character's protective gear. An
              insidious atmosphere worms its way past protection after 2D6 hours on average,
              although vigilant maintenance or advanced protective gear can prolong survival times.
            </dd>
            <dt>Dense, High (D)</dt>
            <dd>
              These worlds have thick N2/O2 atmospheres, but their mean surface pressure is too high
              to support unprotected human life (high pressure nitrogen and oxygen are deadly to
              humans). However, pressure naturally decreases with increasing altitude, so if there
              are highlands at the right altitude the pressure may drop enough to support human
              life. Alternatively, there may not be any topography high enough for humans to
              inhabit, necessitating floating gravitic or dirigible habitats or sealed habitats on
              the surface.
            </dd>
            <dt>Thin, Low (E)</dt>
            <dd>
              The opposite of the Dense, High atmosphere, these massive worlds have thin N2/O2
              atmospheres that settle in the lowlands and depressions and are only breathable there
              – the pressure drops off so rapidly with altitude that the highest topographic points
              of the surface may be close to vacuum.
            </dd>
            <dt>Unusual (F)</dt>
            <dd>
              An Unusual atmosphere is a catchall term for an atmosphere that behaves in a strange
              manner. Examples include ellipsoidal atmospheres, which are thin at the poles and
              dense at the equator; Panthalassic worlds composed of a rocky core surrounded by a
              water layer hundreds of kilometers thick; worlds wracked by storms so intense that
              that the local air pressure changes from dense to thin depending on the current
              weather; and other planets with unusual and hazardous atmospheric conditions.

          <p>
            Sometimes it is enough just to know that a world has hundreds of millions of people on
            it (Population 8). Other times, a Referee or player may want a more specific number. The
            Population Modifier is determined by rolling 2D6-2. If the Population is greater than 0,
            the minimum Population Modifier value is 1. If the Population code is 0, then the
            Population Modifier is also 0. The Population Modifier is multiplied by 10 raised to the
            power of the Population code to determine a more specific number of people living on the
            world. For example, if the Referee generates a Population Modifier of 4 for a world with
            a Population code of 8, then he knows that (4x108, which is…) 400,000,000 people live on
            that world.

            commerce. To determine the world's primary starport, roll 2D6-7 and add the world's
            Population value. Compare the result to the Primary Starport table to determine the
            starport class for the world. Each starport class offers different levels of service.
            The Starport Class Services table provides more specific details.

          <h2 id="planetoid-belt-presence">Planetoid Belt Presence</h2>
          <p>
            Planetoid belts exist in many systems, and are mined by belters for ice, ore and other
            interesting things. To determine the presence of planetoid belts in a given star system,
            throw 4+ on 2D6 for at least one planetoid belt to be present in the system. If
            planetoid belts are present, then the number of planetoid belts in the system is 1D6-3,
            minimum of 1. If the primary world of the system is Size 0, then there's at least one
            planetoid belt in the system automatically.
          </p>

          <h2 id="gas-giant-presence">Gas Giant Presence</h2>
          <p>
            A star system may have one or more gas giant planets. The presence of a gas giant allows
            starships equipped with fuel scoops to refuel by skimming; this eliminates fuel cost for
            the vessel and increases profit. It also allows refueling at systems that do not have
            starports. Refueling in this fashion requires 1D6 hours per 40 tons of fuel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gas giants are relatively common. For each system throw 5+ on 2D6 for at least one gas
            giant to be present in the system. If gas giants are present, then the number of gas
            giants in the system is 1D6-2, minimum of 1.
          </p>

          <h2 id="bases">Bases</h2>
          <p>
            Stellar systems may have bases for military forces, the navy, the scouts, or for other
            arms of interstellar government. Bases can help determine political boundaries within a
            given region of space. An interstellar government will place bases along its borders to
            guard against aggression from rival states, or to control local systems. The presence of
            multiple bases within a few parsecs might indicate a contested border, or a mighty
            stronghold. While other bases may exist, the two primary bases are the Naval Base and
            the Scout Base.
          </p>

          <h3 id="naval-base">Naval Base</h3>
          <p>
            A naval base is a supply depot, refueling station, repair yard or fortress of the Navy.
            Naval vessels can obtain refined fuel and supplies here. If a world possesses a Class-A
            or Class-B starport, throw 8+ on 2D6 to determine the presence of a naval base in the
            system.
          </p>

          <h3 id="scout-base">Scout Base</h3>
          <p>
            A scout base or outpost offers refined fuel and supplies to scout ships. If a world does
            not possess a Class-E or Class-X starport, throw 7+ on 2D6 to determine the presence of
            a scout base in the system. This roll suffers a DM -1 if the world has a Class-C
            starport, a DM -2 for a Class-B starport and a DM -3 for a Class-A starport.
          </p>

          <h3 id="pirate-base">Pirate Base</h3>
          <p>
            A pirate base serves as a haven for interstellar pirates. If a world does not possess a
            Class-A starport or a naval base, throw 12+ on 2D6 to determine the presence of a pirate
            base in the system.
          </p>

          <h3 id="base-codes">Base Codes</h3>
          <p>
            The presence of one or more bases is designated on the hex map with a base code in the
            upper-left of the world hex. The Base Codes table identifies which note-worthy bases, if
            any, are present.

          <h2 id="travel-zones">Travel Zones</h2>
          <p>
            Most worlds are assumed to be civilized, or at least amenable to adventurers and other
            visitors. Some, however, are caught in the throes of war, plagued by disease, or simply
            not ready for interstellar visitors. Such worlds are classified by travel zones to
            denote such status. In most cases, the Referee should indicate travel zones based on the
            information available. Two such zone types exist: amber and red.
          </p>

          <h3 id="amber-zone">Amber Zone</h3>
          <p>
            An Amber world has been deemed dangerous, and travelers are warned to be on their guard.
            Amber worlds are often undergoing upheaval or revolution, or else are naturally
            hazardous environments. A world with an Atmosphere of 10+, a government of 0, 7 or 10,
            or a Law Level of 0 or 9+ should be considered for Amber status.
          </p>

          <h3 id="red-zone">Red Zone</h3>
          <p>
            Red worlds are interdicted and travel to them is forbidden. Interdictions are enforced
            by the Navy. Red zones can indicate that the world is too dangerous to allow visitors.
            The Referee assigns Red worlds at his discretion.
          </p>

          <h2 id="polities-and-world-allegiance">Polities and World Allegiance</h2>
          <p>
            Worlds may be independent, or part of a larger polity that spans a system or more.
            Polities range from loose confederations of a few worlds with common trade or defense
            policies or cultural links, to vast star empires containing thousands of systems and
            trillions of citizens. Polity borders should be drawn on the map. Note that larger
            polities will usually have sub-domains, which should also be marked.
          </p>

          <h2 id="communications-routes-and-trade-routes">
            Communications Routes and Trade Routes
          </h2>
          <p>
            Within the subsector, governments will have established communications and trade routes
            connecting some (but not all) worlds. Messages between businesses, governments and
            people generally follow these routes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communications routes should be carefully drawn so as to avoid making all parts of the
            subsector accessible; a subsector should have some areas as backwaters for exploration
            and adventure. Communications routes are drawn as single lines connecting hexes on the
            subsector grid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trade routes link worlds that have strong commercial ties. Consult the Trade Route
            Worlds table– if any pair of worlds matching the two columns lay within four parsecs of
            each other, and there is a Jump–1 or Jump–2 route between them, then mark a trade route
