          <p class="lead">
            This section describes some of the watercraft that can be commonly encountered in
            Cepheus Engine campaigns. These are not the only types of vessels that exist, and
            creative Referees are encouraged to integrate vehicles of their own creation or from
            other sources as they see fit.
          </p>

          <h2 id="standard-designs-vs-new-designs">Standard Designs vs. New Designs</h2>
          <p>
            An interstellar economy provides an excellent opportunity for the use of standardized
            and modular vehicle designs, as well as a wide range of markets. Components can be
            crafted on different worlds, taking advantage of available resources, and then put
            together to create a final product. Manufacturers take advantage of modular components
            and standardized designs to reduce costs in production, leading to a 10% discount on
            vehicles constructed using common designs, such as those described in the other chapters
            of this supplement. The Referee may designate other vehicle designs as standard designs,
            as befits their universe. Fuel and weapon ammunition are not covered by the Std Design
            Discount.
          </p>
          <p>
            New and unique vehicle designs cannot take advantage of standardized and modular design.
            These vehicles must be designed by a vehicular design specialist, who creates detailed
            design plans based on a set of specifications provided by their client. Such plans take
            a month to create, and costs approximately 1% of the final price of the vehicle, to a
            minimum of Cr100.
          </p>

          <h2 id="displacement-tons-and-spaces">Displacement Tons and Spaces</h2>
          <p>
            Chassis and other vehicle components are measured by their displacement volume. For
            ships and small craft, displacement volume is measured in the volume of space that is
            displaced by one metric ton of hydrogen, referred to in this design sequence as
            displacement tons or simply tons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the components for vehicles are often fractions of a ton, the Cepheus Engine
            Vehicle Design System (VDS) uses an artificial measure of volume to make things a little
            easier. A space in this design system is equal to one-twelfth of a displacement ton;
            i.e. there are 12 spaces in one ton.
          </p>

          <h2 id="design-considerations">Design Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            When designing a vehicle, it is important to consider two things: the vehicleâ€™s purpose,
            and the Tech Level at which it will be produced. The design process flows more smoothly
            when you keep these two factors in mind
          </p>

          <h2 id="price-impact-of-modifications">The Price Impact of Modifications</h2>
          <p>
            Some modifications to a vehicle component, often classified under Options that can be
            applied to that component, modify the original price of that component. Modifications
            that decrease the price of a vehicle component cannot lower it below 25% of the original
            price.
          </p>

          <h2 id="vehicle-chassis">Vehicle Chassis</h2>
          <p>
            The vesselâ€™s chassis is the shell in which all other components are placed. An unarmored
            vehicleâ€™s construction time is based on its chassis size, as outlined on the
            <a href="#vehicle-chassis-by-displacement">Vehicle Chassis by Displacement table</a>. To
            find the construction time for armored vehicles, simply multiply the vehicleâ€™s base
            construction time by the amount of <b><i>additional</i></b> armor the vehicle will
            possess. For example, a 10-ton Armored Fighting Vehicle (AFV) with a total of 12 Armor
            would take (base of 90 hours, times 12, equals) 1080 hours, or 45 days, assuming
            round-the-clock construction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Custom-Made Vehicles:</b> The construction time listed is for mass production of a
            standard design. A custommade vehicle takes approximately ten times as long to
            construct.

              closed chassis to safeguard the vehicle and its crew in corrosive environments.
              Corrosive Environmental Protection protects against corrosive environments, very hot
              or very cold environments, radiation, poisons and bacteriological threats. This system
              takes up 6 spaces and costs Cr10,000 per Space of chassis. This system requires the

              The Insidious Environmental Protection System can be installed in any vehicles with a
              closed chassis to safeguard the vehicle and its crew in insidious environments.
              Insidious Environmental Protection protects the vehicle and crew from insidious
              atmospheres for 5 days, before Hull/Structure integrity begins to fail at one point
              per day, as well as providing protection against very hot or very cold environments,
              radiation, poisons and bacteriological threats. This system takes up 6 spaces and

              A self-sealing chassis automatically repairs minor breaches, and prevents chassis hits
              from leading to explosive decompression in vacuum environments (if the Vacuum
              Environmental Protection System is installed). It costs Cr10,000 per ton of chassis.

            <dt>Streamlined</dt>
            <dd>
              Streamlining a thrust-based vehicle increases the chassis price by 300%. Streamlining
              multiplies the Base Speed of the vehicle by 5. Streamlining can be applied to any
              thrust-based vehicle with a closed configuration. Streamlining may not be retrofitted;
              it must be included at the time of construction.

            <dd>
              <p>
                Submersible may be applied to any aquatic vessel, allowing it to submerge below the
                oceanâ€™s surface. The Submersible configuration option increase the chassis price by
                500%. Base Speed for a submersible reflects the vesselâ€™s speed underwater. The
                vehicleâ€™s Base Speed is halved when the vehicle is travelling on the oceanâ€™s surface
                in good weather conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Submersibles are rated by their Safe Dive Depth and Crush Depth, as determined by
                the vesselâ€™s Tech Level. These values are calculated for a Size 8 world. For every
                point of world size difference, up or down, add or subtract (respectively) 10% from
                the Safe Dive and Crush Depth values.
              </p>
              <p>
                When increasing Safe Dive/Crush Depth for a submersible, for every doubling of the
                Safe Dive and Crush Depth, the vehicle loses half of its remains spaces (rounded
                off) to ballast to bring the vehicle lower into the ocean. Each doubling costs of
                100% of the chassis price of the submersible.
              </p>
              <p>
                An open chassis submersible, such as a dive sled, does not protect its drivers or
                passengers from the pressures of the depths of the ocean.
              </p>
              <p>

              The Wave-piercing Hull puts the payload of a watercraft on streamlined pillars above
              the water that connect to power/fuel modules that run underwater. Interface friction
              is much reduced, allowing the Wave-piercing Hull to be much more efficient and stable.
              This increases its Base Speed by 10%. The Wavepiercing Hull uses 5% of a vehicleâ€™s
              Spaces (round up) and costs 200% of the chassis price.

          <h2 id="vehicle-armor">Vehicle Armor</h2>
          <p>
            All vehicles start with a base amount of armor, depending on their construction
            materials, as outlined in the Vehicle Armor by Type table. All additional vehicle armor,
            regardless of armor type, is added in 5% increments of the vehicleâ€™s volume, in Spaces.
            A vehicleâ€™s armor decreases ambient radiation exposure by 10 rads per point of armor.
            (This does not apply to meson attacks and nuclear missiles, which bypass the armor or
            breach the chassis to deliver their radiation hits.) Note that these armor values are
            measured on the Personal Combat scale. The maximum armor a vehicle can carry is 20% of
            the chassis.

            For example, a heavily armored TL14 grav tank might take Bonded Superdense armor twice.
            This would take up 10% of the chassis volume (in spaces, minimum 2 spaces) and cost 100%
            of the base price of the chassis, but give 12 additional points of armor.

          <h3 id="vehicle-armor-options">Vehicle Armor Options</h3>
          <p>The following are options that can be added to a vehicle's armor.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Electrostatic Armor (TL 9)</dt>
            <dd>
              This armor can be set to generate an electrostatic field that, when triggered by a
              person or creature, inflicts 6D6 damage. The armor may discharge twice before needing
              to recharge, and completely recharges after six seconds without a discharge.
              Electrostatic Armor requires one Space for the supporting capacitor and associated
              electronics, and costs Cr10,000.
            </dd>
            <dt>Reflec (TL 10)</dt>
            <dd>
              Reflec coating on the chassis increases the vehicleâ€™s armor against lasers by 3.
              Adding Reflec costs Cr100,000 per ton of chassis and can only be added once.
            </dd>
            <dt>Reinforced Hull</dt>
            <dd>
              A vehicleâ€™s Hull can be reinforced through enhanced structural engineering, increasing
              its Hull rating in Personal Combat by +1. This costs 20% of the vehicleâ€™s chassis
              price. This can be selected twice for a total of +2 to the vehicleâ€™s Hull.
            </dd>
            <dt>Reinforced Structure</dt>
            <dd>
              A vehicleâ€™s Structure can be reinforced through enhanced engineering designs,
              increasing its Structure rating in Personal Combat by +1. This costs 20% of the
              vehicleâ€™s chassis price. This modification can be selected twice for a total of +2 to
              the vehicleâ€™s Structure.
            </dd>
            <dt>Stealth (TL 11)</dt>
            <dd>
              A stealth coating absorbs radar and lidar beams, and also disguises heat emissions.
              This imposes a â€“4 DM on any Comms rolls to detect or lock onto the vehicle. Adding
              Stealth costs Cr100,000 per ton of chassis, and can only be added once.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h3 id="vehicle-hull-and-structure">Vehicle Hull and Structure</h3>
          <p>
            Initial damage is applied to the Hull value of the chassis; once the chassis has been
            breached (i.e. the Hull value of the vehicle has reached zero), further damage goes to
            the Structure. When all Structure Points have been lost, the vehicle has been smashed to
            pieces. On the Space Combat scale, every vehicle has 0 Hull Points and 1 Structure
            Point. On the Personal Combat scale, a vehicle has one Hull Point per 5 tons of
            displacement (rounded down) and one Structure Point per 5 tons of displacement (rounded
            up). This is summarized in the Vehicle Hull and Structure, Personal Combat Scale table.

          <h2 id="vehicle-drives">Vehicle Drives</h2>
          <p>
            All vehicles are generally built with at least one source of power (commonly referred to
            as the engine or power plant) and one source of propulsion or locomotion to provide
            movement for the vehicle. Propulsion is defined as either contact-based (requiring
            contact with the ground to provide motion) or thrust-based. Within the Cepheus Engine
            VDS, all engines, power plants and propulsion systems are categorized as drives.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Power Plants</dt>
            <dd>
              Within this design system, the values of the
              <a href="#vehicle-drive-costs">Vehicle Drive Costs</a> tables make certain
              assumptions. Power plant values represent the fusion engine. The
              <a href="#vehicle-power-plant-types">Vehicle Power Plant Types</a>
              table offer adjustments to represent the impact of alternate power sources.
            </dd>
            <dt>Propulsion Systems</dt>
            <dd>
              The contact-based propulsion system values represent the transmission and suspension
              of wheeled vehicles. The thrust-based propulsion system values represent the
              suspension of grav vehicles. The Vehicle Propulsion Types table offers adjustments to
              represent alternate propulsion systems.
            </dd>
            <dt>Base Speed</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                The base speed of a vehicle is determined by its propulsion drive performance and
                its propulsion type, as outlined in the
                <a href="#vehicle-base-speed-by-drive-performance"
                  >Vehicle Base Speed by Drive Performance</a
                >
                table. Base speed is measured in kilometers per hour (kph), unless otherwise
                specified.
              </p>
              <p>
                A vehicle with a propulsion system must have a power source with a drive code equal
                to or greater than that of the vehicleâ€™s propulsion. When determining the drive
                performance of a power plant or a contact-based propulsion system using the
                <a href="#drive-performance-by-chassis-volume"
                  >Drive Performance by Chassis Volume</a
                >
                tables, treat a zero (0) entry as a â€˜&mdash;â€™ entry. For a thrust-based propulsion
                system, a zero (0) means that the thrust from the propulsion system is capable of
                supporting the vehicle itself in position, hovering in place, but cannot perform any
                actual propulsion. This allows vehicle designers to create vehicles that only move
                down or remain stationary, but canâ€™t move up or forward at any significant speed.
                This is primarily used for robots and drones that need to remain stationary in
                turbulent circumstances.

            <dt>Animal-Powered or Wind-Powered Vehicles</dt>
            <dd>
              Vehicles that possess no internal power plant or engine, such as those propelled by
              wind or pulled by living creatures, do not require a power plant as defined in this
              section, since their power comes from an external source. In this case, the vehicle
              must possess a drive capable of achieving a drive performance of at least 1. For more
              details on wind-powered or animal-powered vehicles, see

          <h2 id="vehicle-fuel">Vehicle Fuel</h2>
          <p>
            Every vehicle carries fuel, unless it derives its power from an external source. All
            fuel calculations are calculated based on the power plantâ€™s Drive Code and Power Plant
            Type, as well as the expected period of operation without refueling. The power plant
            fuel requirements for early fusion engines are outlined in the
            <a href="#power-plant-fuel-requirements">Vehicle Power Plant Fuel Requirements</a>
            table. Fuel consumption for other power plant types is detailed in the
            <a href="#vehicle-fuel-consumption-by-power-plant"
              >Vehicle Fuel Consumption by Power Plant Type</a
            >
            table.
          </p>
          <p>
            The amount of fuel required by the power plant depends on the volume of the power plant
            itself, and is calculated as one-third of the power plant tonnage per week. Vehicles are
            designed to operate for a variety of durations, ranging from a few hours to days or even
            weeks. For your convenience, the
            <a href="#power-plant-fuel-requirements">Vehicle Power Plant Fuel Requirements</a>
            table provides calculated values for the fuel per week, per day and per hour, by Drive
            Code. For purposes of describing fuel volume in a vehicleâ€™s description, assume that the
            number of spaces of fuel is equivalent to the kiloliters of volume it occupies. Divide
            calculated fuel space by 12 to determine fuel volume in tons.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Range and Cruising Speed:</b> The amount of fuel a vehicle carries determines its
            Range at its maximum speed. The cruising speed of a vehicle is assumed to be 75% of the
            vehicleâ€™s maximum speed and if the vehicle maintains this rate of movement, its Range
            will increase by 50% due to fuel efficiency.

          <dl>
            <dt>Additional Drive Systems</dt>
            <dd>
              A secondary drive system can be installed in a vehicle by purchasing a second
              propulsion drive. The secondary drive systemâ€™s performance is limited to one less than
              that of the primary drive system. The vehicleâ€™s Agility suffers aâ€“1 penalty due to
              design accommodations required to support the additional drive system.
            </dd>
            <dt>Decreased Agility</dt>
            <dd>
              Vehicles can be built with lowered Agility, normally done for reasons of cost. Each
              reduction of â€“1 Agility reduces the final price of the vehicle by 25% of its chassis
              price. The maximum decrease to a vehicleâ€™s Agility is -2.
            </dd>
            <dt>Decreased Fuel Efficiency</dt>
            <dd>
              Vehicles can be built with decreased fuel efficiency, relying on cheaper parts or less
              efficient engines to cut costs. Fuel inefficient vehicles multiply the Fuel Mod on the
              Vehicle Fuel Consumption by Power Plant Type by 1.25 (increasing the fuel consumed by
              25%). This reduces the final price of the vehicle by 10% of its chassis price.
            </dd>
            <dt>Extra Leg(s)</dt>
            <dd>
              Walkers are typically assumed to have two legs. Additional legs can also be added to
              improve mobility in rough and uneven terrain. Each additional legs costs 25% of the
              vehicleâ€™s Contact-Based Drive Price and takes up an additional 5% of the vehicleâ€™s
              Contact-Based Drive Space. Every pair of additional legs reduces any terrain-based
              maneuver penalties by 1. This cannot be used to provide a bonus, only to negate a
              penalty. In addition, any walker with four or more legs gains a DM+1 on attack rolls
              made with the vehicleâ€™s weapons.
            </dd>
            <dt>Extra Pair of Wheels</dt>
            <dd>
              Wheeled vehicles are typically assumed to have four wheels (except for small vehicles
              of 0.5 tons or less in size, which may have two wheels at the designerâ€™s discretion.)
              Additional wheels can be added to improve cross-country mobility. Each additional pair
              of wheels costs 25% of the vehicleâ€™s Contact-Based Drive Price, takes up 25% of the
              vehicleâ€™s Contact-Based Drive Space, and reduces any terrain-based Agility penalties
              by 1. This cannot be used to provide a bonus, only to negate a penalty.
            </dd>
            <dt>Increased Agility</dt>
            <dd>
              Each +1 to Agility costs 50% of the chassis price. The maximum increase to a vehicleâ€™s
              Agility is +3.
            </dd>
            <dt>Increased Fuel Efficiency</dt>
            <dd>
              Vehicles can be built with increased fuel efficiency. Fuel efficient vehicles multiply
              the Fuel Mod on the Vehicle Fuel Consumption by Power Plant Type by 0.9 (reducing the

            <dt>Jump Jets</dt>
            <dd>
              Any ground vehicle or hovercraft can be built with Jump Jets. These vehicles use jump
              jets primarily for crossing obstacles, but jump jets can also be used to allow the
              vehicle to fly, albeit inefficiently and no higher than 100 meters off the surface. To
              determine the size and cost of the Jump Jets unit, select a Thrust-based Drive that
              provides a minimum Drive Performance of 1 from the
              <a href="#vehicle-drive-costs">Vehicle Drive Costs</a> table, and multiply both Spaces
              and Price by 0.75. When flying through the use of jump jets, the vehicles moves at
              one-quarter of the Base Speed for the Jump Jets unit, and consumes fuel five times
              faster than normal

            <dt>Off-Road Capability</dt>
            <dd>
              Any ground vehicle can be purposefully designed for off-road use. This modification
              costs 50% of the vehicleâ€™s Contact-Based Drive Price, and the vehicleâ€™s Base Speed is
              lowered by 10%. A vehicle that is off-road capable does not suffer the â€“2 DM to
              Agility for moving off-road, and its Speed is not reduced. In addition, it can cross
              rough terrain with a â€“2 DM to Agility.
            </dd>
            <dt>Tilt Rotors/Jets</dt>
            <dd>
              Aircraft equipped with tilt rotors gain the ability to takeoff vertically and hover
              like a helicopter. Once the rotors or jets rotate forward, the aircraft flies
              normally. Adding this component triples the Price of the Thrust-based drive.

          <h2 id="vehicle-agility">Vehicle Agility</h2>
          <p>
            Some vehicles are easier to drive than others. A vehicleâ€™s Agility rating reflects how
            easy the vehicle is to drive, and is expressed as a DM to the pilotâ€™s skill check. A
            vehicleâ€™s base Agility is determined by a number of factors, including the size of the
            vehicleâ€™s chassis and its primary propulsion type. To determine a vehicleâ€™s Agility
            rating, consult the Vehicle Agility Modifiers table, and sum up all appropriate
            modifiers.

            Unlike starships, vehicles do not have bridges. Instead, vehicles require a control

          <p>
            Vehicle sensors allow the crew to identify, track and jam other vehicles. These sensor
            systems operate similarly to those installed on a starship or small craft. The type of
            sensor package installed can impose a DM on Comms skill checks when using the system to
            perform sensor-related tasks. Vehicle sensor systems are optional, but often highly
            recommended, particularly for military vehicles.

              Sensor packages intended for use underwater must be purchased separately. Surface
              sensors cannot be used underwater, and vice versa. Underwater sensors cost the same as
              standard vehicle sensors, but require an additional 12 Spaces, and the Max Range drops
              by one category, to a minimum of Very Long (500m).

          <h2 id="vehicle-crew-and-passengers">Vehicle Crew and Passengers</h2>
          <p>
            All vehicles require a crew to operate and maintain the vehicle. For civilian vehicles,
            that is typically one operator or driver. Military vehicles also require one gunner per
            weapon and one commander if three or more crew members are required. Every vehicle
            requires at least a basic cockpit or a basic control cabin to interface with the
            vehicleâ€™s control, communication and sensor systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            For vehicles intended for only a few waking hours, short-term accommodations are
            suggested for crew and passengers. If a vehicle is intended for use over several days or
            longer, long-term accommodations would be a better design implementation.

            <dt>Sailing Vessels</dt>
            <dd>
              Sailing vessels calculate vehicle crew differently. Subtract the Tech Level of the
              sailboat from 10 (minimum 1) to determine the number of crew needed to work the sails
              for every four tons of sailing vessel or portion thereof. Sailing vessels of two tons
              or less require half this amount.

              The design plan must indicate cargo capacity. There is no price but cargo carried may
              not exceed cargo capacity. Any Spaces left over after all systems have been installed
              may be allocated to cargo space. Divide the remaining Spaces by 12 to determine the
              volume of the cargo hold in displacement tons.

                Ground vehicles can be equipped to tow a cargo trailer. Vehicles pulling a cargo
                trailer suffer a -1 penalty to Agility; vehicles of two displacement tons or smaller
                suffer an additional -1 penalty to Agility. The
                <a href="#cargo-trailer-by-size">Cargo Trailer by Size</a> table describes the price
                and capacity (in Spaces) for each trailer type. A vehicleâ€™s Towing Speed is equal to
                their Base Speed without the trailer attached, multiplied by the ratio of the
                vehicleâ€™s chassis (in Spaces) divided by the sum of the vehicleâ€™s chassis and the
                cargo trailerâ€™s capacity (both in Spaces). Towing Speeds are rounded down to the
                nearest multiple of 10kph.

          <h2 id="vehicle-armaments">Vehicle Armaments</h2>
          <p>
            Military vehicles, as well as civilian vehicles in certain star systems, often carry
            weapons. Vehicles carry weapons in one of four ways: gun ports, weapon mounts, vehicular
            turrets, and ordinance bays.
          </p>

          <h3 id="gun-ports">Gun Ports</h3>
          <p>
            Gun ports are mounts for small arms. Gun ports cost Cr250 each, and require no Spaces.
            Gun Ports are used at Personal Weapon Ranges only, and do not benefit from stabilization
            or fire control. Gun Ports do not require a vehicle weapon point (see Weapon Mount,
            below). A gun port allows the gunner to benefit from the vehicle's armor, except when
            the attacker is adjacent to the gun port itself.
          </p>

          <h3 id="weapon-mounts">Weapon Mounts</h3>
          <p>
            A <b>weapon point</b> is a location on a vessel or vehicle designed to carry an external
            or internal load. A vehicle's chassis or a vessel's hull can support one weapon point
            per 5 tons, with a minimum of one. For example, a twoton vehicle has one weapon point,
            while a ten-ton vehicle would have two weapon points, and an 800-ton naval destroyer has
            160 weapon points.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weapon mounts come in three varieties: fixed, ring and pintle. A fixed mount is
            permanently affixed to the chassis, and cannot move or be removed. A pintle mount is
            effectively a post upon which the weapon is affixed, and the weapon pivots on the point
            of attachment to aim and fire. A ring mount is effectively a ring of metal that serves
            as the track upon which the weapon traverses as the weapon is aimed and fired.
          </p>
          <p>
            A weapon mount may be attached to an open weapon point on the vehicle, and a weapon
            point may only support one weapon mount. Weapon mounts do not offer any sort of fire
            control. Weapon mounts do not take up any Spaces themselves, nor do they add any extra
            Spaces to a vehicle. Weapons in a weapon mount still count against the available Spaces
            in a vehicle.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Fixed Mount</dt>
            <dd>
              weapons cannot move, and so are limited to firing in one direction (normally straight
              ahead). A fixed mount has no price and must simply be noted at time of construction.
            </dd>
            <dt>Gun Shields</dt>
            <dd>
              Both pintle and ring mounts can be equipped with gun shields, which provide the gunner
              with Armor equal to half the tech level of the vehicle rounded down, minimum of one,
              in the direction the weapon is facing.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h3 id="vehicle-turrets">Vehicle Turrets</h3>
          <p>
            Vehicle turrets come in two varieties: small and large. A vehicle turret takes up one
            weapon point per 60 Spaces in size, or fraction thereof, of the turret itself. A small
            turret is only big enough to fit the weapon installed, and is remotely controlled from
            within the vehicle, while a large turret holds both the installed weapon and its
            operator. Vehicle turrets can also represent gun pods and other housing for larger
            weapons on vehicles.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Coaxial (or Paraxial) Mounts</dt>
            <dd>
              Multiple weapons can be mounted in the same turret. All weapons mounted in the same
              turret have the same firing arc. Such turrets consume an additional weapon point per
              additional weapon beyond the first. This is in addition to the standard allocation of
              one weapon point per 60 Spaces in size, or fraction thereof, of the turret itself.
            </dd>
            <dt>Pop-Up</dt>
            <dd>
              is a quality that can be applied to any type of turret - the turret is concealed in a
              pod or recess on the hull, and is detectable only when deployed. A ship with all its
              weapons in pop-up turrets looks unarmed to a casual sensor scan.

          <dl>
            <dt>Disintegrators</dt>
            <dd>
              The Effect used with a disintegrator is not determined by the attack roll; instead it
              is equal to the Armor rating of the target - meaning that the weapon will always
              inflict damage if it hits.
            </dd>
            <dt>Meson Weapons</dt>
            <dd>
              Meson weapons are unaffected by armor, as the blast only becomes harmful after it has
              already passed through the hull. Meson guns also inflict an automatic radiation hit on
              the crew of any target struck.
            </dd>
            <dt>Pulse Weapons</dt>
            <dd>
              Energy weapons, such as lasers, with the pulse designation fire short, rapid bursts of

          <p>
            Dedicated ordinance bays that carry just one type of weapon cost Cr5,000 per Space of
            weapon that they are designed to hold. Rate-of-fire is equal to the number of weapons in
            the bay, and bays can be reloaded. General purpose ordinance bays able to hold different
            types of weapons cost Cr10,000 per Space of weapon they are designed to hold. They can
            launch one missile or torpedo per round, or drop up to half their Space capacity in
            bombs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that an ordinance bay takes up one weapon point per 60 Spaces in size, or fraction
            thereof, of the bay itself, minimum of one. For example, a Heavy Nuclear Bomb ordinance
            bay housing four such bombs occupies 24 Spaces, which takes up one weapon point. An
            ordinance bay housing 15 Heavy High Explosive Bombs occupies 90 spaces, and takes up two
            weapon points

            A number of vehicular weapons determine range and damage by the type of tactical
            missiles they fire. Common missiles are listed in the Vehicular Missiles table. Standard

              The attack roll for smart missiles is always 8+, and they may attack every combat

            Systems of this type will typically negate an incoming missile, rocket, launched grenade
            or mortar round on the roll of 8+. Some systems have Target DMs that modify this, and
            every system will suffer a -1 DM for every additional target it is forced to engage in
            each round. The Anti-Missile System Details table describes each system.

          <h3 id="alien-vehicles">Alien Vehicles</h3>
          <p>
            The Cepheus Engine VDS assumes that the vehicle designs are based on humans or humanoid
            creatures with similar physiological constraints as humans. Alien vehicles typically
            follow the same design process as humans, but exceptions, particularly in
            accommodations, may exist based on differences in physiology. The Referee is the final
            arbiter on those differences.
          </p>

          <h3 id="airship-balloon-lift-envelope">Airship/Balloon Lift Envelope</h3>
          <p>
            Airships and balloons require a lift envelope to hold the lower-density gasses that
            allow the vessels to fly. Hydrogen and helium balloons can stay aloft almost
            indefinitely. Hot-air balloons have a duration equal to their Tech Level x 2 hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inflated size of an envelope in Spaces can be calculated as per the formula found in
            the Lift Envelope Size by Atmosphere Density table. The envelope is not considered part
            of the chassis itself, but can be stored away in a space with a displacement volume
            equal to one percent (1%) of its inflated size.
          </p>
          <p>
            All non-explosive weapons inflict only 1 point of damage to the envelope for each hit.
            Automatic weapons inflict damage equal to their Auto Rating. Once the lift envelope has
            taken an amount of Structure damage equal to one point per 60 Spaces of lift envelope
            size, it loses integrity.

            Agility if they are within 1 of their home UWP codes for atmosphere and/or size, and
            cannot fly at all if they are operating beyond this, unless they are designed with a
            wider operation range. In any case, all aircraft require a minimum atmosphere code of 1
            in order to function. Aircraft descriptions should include the world size and atmosphere
            codes.

              Aircraft can be designed with a wider operational environment range. This costs 100%
              of the Base Price of the aircraft but allows it to be used within two digits of the
              UPP size and atmosphere values instead of just one. These aircraft also suffer a -1 to

            the sake of simplicity, they can be assumed to strike after a number of turns dependent
            on launch range, as shown in the Missile/Torpedo Time to Impact table. Missiles and

            When the missile or torpedo is launched, the gunner must make a Turret Weapons or Bay
            Weapons skill check to determine the accuracy of the launch. The effect of the skill
            check determines the chance that the missile or torpedo will strike its target when it
            hits. A target may react to incoming missiles or torpedoes by dodging or point defense.
            This reaction does not take place until the turn the missiles arrive at their
            destination, so any target response must wait until then.

              required Strength for movement.) For every five points of Strength less than what is
              required, Speed and Range decrease by 10%. There is no lower limit and Speed can be
              reduced to 0 so the vehicle cannot move at all.

              Often called sailing vessels, wind-powered vehicles depend on the wind and weather to
              provide the force necessary to move. The Sailing Speeds table captures the base speeds
              of different types of vehicles, as a percentage of wind speed. In the table,
              water-based also refers to water or similar fluids, depending on the world for which
              the vessel is designed.

          <p>
            The listed movement rate for any ground vehicle is its on-road movement. If a ground
            vehicle goes off-road, it suffers a -2 DM to Agility, Movement rate is reduced to 25% of
            normal and rough terrain cannot be crossed. A vehicle that is off-road capable does not
            suffer the -2 DM to Agility, and the Movement rate is not reduced. It can cross rough
            terrain with a -2 DM to Agility.

          <p>
            Some vehicles, such as ocean liners and other large watercraft, exceed the usual 20 tons
            limit defined by the Vehicle Design System. When designing vehicles of such size, the
            process remains much the same, with the following exceptions:
          </p>

            <li>

                >Smallcraft or Ship Design systems in the Cepheus Engine Core Rules</a
              >. Because the hull does not have to be spaceworthy, divide the hull price by 25 to
              get an appropriate price for the chassis. Multiply the tonnage of the chassis by 12 to
              get the number of Spaces available. Construction time remains the same as the original
              hull.

                Smallcraft or Ship Design system to represent the vehicleâ€™s power plant. The
                differences in power plant construction for vehicles as opposed to space ships lead
                to a few changes in volume and price. Modify these values as needed based on Power

          <h2 id="universal-vehicle-description-format">Universal Vehicle Description Format</h2>
          <p>
            After a vehicle design has been created, it must be presented in a format that allows
            players to use the information within the game. The Cepheus Engine VDS describes vehicle
            designs using a universal vehicle description format, which is essentially a paragraph
            of text laid out in the following manner. Examples can be found in
            <a href="common-aircraft.html">Chapter 2: Common Aircraft</a>
            through
