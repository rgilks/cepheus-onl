          <h1>Chapter 10: Space Combat</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            Space combat is a staple in classic science fiction, and the Cepheus Engine has rules to
            cover it. This chapter details the basics for space combat. These rules for vehicle and
            starship combat presented here are designed to allow for more roleplaying and
            involvement of the characters. Movement and maneuvering are abstracted to allow for
            cinematic battles as vessels attempt to maneuver into a position of pursuit and
            advantage against their opponents, or frantically try to shake pursuit.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Range is similarly abstracted, needing only to note whether the range for all vessels
            involved for each round is Close, Short, Medium, Long, Very Long, or Extreme.
          </p>

          <h2 id="space-combat-checklist">Space Combat Checklist</h2>
          <p>
            Like <a href="personal-combat.html">personal combat</a>, space combat in the Cepheus
            Engine is cyclical. Everybody acts in turn in a regular cycle called a turn. Each turn
            in space combat lasts one kilosecond. Generally, space combat runs in the following way:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>The Referee determines the range at which the encounter begins</li>
            <li>All crew members are assigned to a position on board their vessel</li>
            <li>
              The Referee determines which characters are aware of their opponents at the start of
              the battle. If some but not all vessels are aware of their opponents, the vessels that
              are aware of their opponents are considered to get an automatic 12 on their initiative
              roll, giving them an Initiative of 12 + Dexterity DM
            </li>
            <li>
              Any remaining vessels roll initiative. All vessels are now ready to begin their first
              turn of combat
            </li>
            <li>
              All vessels act in initiative order
              <ol type="a">
                <li>
                  At the start of each combat turn, a Captain may declare that their crew is acting
                  hastily
                </li>
                <li>The crew members of the vessel resolve their actions</li>
                <li>
                  After every crew member has completed their actions, any damage is resolved if the
                  vessel's weapon systems hit enemy ships
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              When every vessel has had a turn, the combatant with the highest initiative total acts
              again, and Step 5 repeats until combat ends
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="range-in-space-combat">Range in Space Combat</h2>
          <p>
            If two vessels randomly encounter each other while travelling through the depths of
            space, far from any other objects or vessels, the encounter will begin at Very Long
            range. More often, ships engage near a planet, where the range is Short or Medium.

          <h2 id="space-combat-turn">The Space Combat Turn</h2>
          <p>
            Each turn in space combat lasts around one kilosecond (1,000 seconds) of game time. In a
            combat turn, vessels have individual Initiative. Actions are taken in descending order
            of Initiative. If two vessels have the same Initiative, the vessel with the highest
            Thrust goes first. If they are still tied, then vessels act simultaneously. When a
            vessel acts, the crew members of the vessel take all of their actions at once. Each crew
            member gets a minor action and a significant action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once everyone has acted a combat turn is over and a new turn begins. Initiative is not
            re-rolled but is dynamic, and may be adjusted up and down by actions taken during a
            turn.
          </p>

          <h2 id="note-on-personal-actions">Note on Personal Actions</h2>
          <p>
            As a space combat turn represents over 150 personal combat rounds, it stands to reason
            that crew members may engage in a lot of personal actions over the course of a single
            combat turn. Much of this is abstracted into the various space combat actions. Most
            personal actions have minimal impact on space combat. For crew members that do want to
            pursue a personal action during space combat, such as use a psionic ability, these
            actions count as minor actions on the space combat scale. This glosses over the
            remainder of the character's time during the combat turn, and highlights the primary
            acts that a character might want to pursue without taking away from the rest of the
            space combat.

          <p>
            Crew members changes crew positions, and are now considered to be manning their new

          <h3 id="maintain-course">Maintain Course</h3>
          <p>
            The pilot keeps the vessel on its current course and heading, remaining at the current

          <p>
            Significant actions are intended to do something within about 3 seconds. You can perform
            a single significant action per turn, or forego it to perform a total of three minor
            actions.

            determined by range, adding any Computer Targeting, Sensor Targeting, or other modifiers
            in effect this round for his vessel. The enemy ship may react by dodging, point defense
            or triggering screens (see <a href="#reactions">Reactions</a>). A gunner may fire any or
            all of the weapons in his turret or bay but each turret or bay may only fire once per
            round. If the attack is successful it will inflict damage. Damage is resolved after all
            attacks have been made in a vessel's turn. Missiles do not impact in the same round they
            are launched; their damage is resolved in the combat turn that they impact their target.

          <h3 id="avoid-collision">Avoid Collision</h3>
          <p>
            When a vessel is moving at Short or Close range through a debris field, traffic, an
            asteroid belt, a planetary ring, or similar situation where there is a reasonable chance
            of collision with another object, the pilot must make an Avoid Collision check each
            turn. A collision inflicts 1D6 damage for every point of the vessel's current speed.

            are merely adjacent, then the attackers must use thruster packs or small craft to cross
            over. While crossing, the attackers may be attacked with point defense weapons or by
            firing sand. Once across, boarding actions can be resolved using the personal combat

          <p>
            The Captain makes an Average(+0)
            <a href="skills.html#leadership">Leadership</a> skill check. The Captain gains a pool of

          <h3 id="electronic-warfare">Electronic Warfare</h3>
          <p>
            A sensors operator may attempt to jam radio communications and sensor locks by making an

          <p>
            Alternatively, electronic warfare can be used to attack smart missiles that are
            targeting the ship. The sensors operator makes a Difficult (–2)
            <a href="skills.html#comms">Comms</a> check and, if successful, a single attacking smart
            missile ceases attacking. The sensors operator may continue making checks to disable
            smart missiles until he fails one, with a cumulative –1 DM each time.

          <h3 id="evasive-maneuvers">Evasive Manuevers</h3>
          <p>
            The pilot operates the vessel in an erratic manner in an attempt to avoid being hit by
            opposing weapons fire. The Pilot makes an Average(+0)
            <a href="skills.html#piloting">Piloting</a> skill check. If successful, any attack rolls
            targeting the pilot's vessel suffer a DM-1 penalty, or DM-2 with an Exceptional Success.

          <h3 id="increase-initiative">Increase Initiative</h3>
          <p>
            The Captain of a vessel may make a

            vessel by the Effect of the check. This increase only applies for the following turn.

          <h3 id="intercept-enemy-communications">Intercept Enemy Communications</h3>
          <p>
            The sensors operator may attempt to intercept enemy communications. This requires a
            Difficult(-2)
            <a href="skills.html#comms">Comms</a> skill check. Encryption (if any) must also be
            broken. Knowledge of enemy intentions can be valuable to a Captain, if they know how to
            use it. The Captain may make an Easy (+4)
            <a href="skills.html#tactics">Tactics</a> check to gain an advantage from intercepted
            communications. If successful, the Captain gains knowledge of the enemy's dispositions
            or intentions. This translates to a one-time DM+4 bonus to any skill check affecting the
            enemy (e.g. a pilot's attempt to evade a sudden attack, or a gunner's precise shot just
            as the enemy vessel turns to present a better target.) Of course, the enemy must have
            communications for them to be intercepted.
          </p>

          <h3 id="line-up-the-shot">Line Up the Shot</h3>
          <p>
            A pilot may attempt to aid his gunners by providing a stable firing platform along an
            optimum attack vector. The pilot makes a
            <a href="skills.html#piloting">Piloting</a> check to aid his gunners, granting a DM+1 on
            all attacks rolls this turn with a success, or a DM+2 with an Exceptional Success.
          </p>

          <h3 id="maintain-communications">Maintain Communications</h3>
          <p>
            The sensors operator can establish and maintain communications between allied vessels
            with a Routine(+2)
            <a href="skills.html#comms">Comms</a> skill check. If there is significant interference
            or a lot of communications going on (e.g. due to bad comm. discipline among a fleet),
            treat as Considerable Noise (DM-2). Deliberate comms jamming requires an opposed
            <a href="skills.html#comms">Comms</a> skill check with the jammer. If reliable
            communications are not established, vessels cannot act in concert, and Tactics skill
            cannot be applied.
          </p>

          <h3 id="pursuit">Pursuit</h3>
          <p>
            If a pilot makes a successful opposed
            <a href="skills.html#piloting">Piloting</a> skill check against another vessel within
            Short or Close range travelling at the same speed as the pilot's vessel, the successful
            pilot has placed his vessel in pursuit of his target maintaining the current range and
            matching the target ship move for move. Once a pursuit has been established, it must be
            maintained each turn to take advantage of the position. Maintaining a pursuit is a
            significant action that does not require a skill check. It is automatically maintained
            unless the target succeeds at the Break Pursuit action, manages to extend the range
            between the vessels to Medium or greater, or succeeds in outpacing the speed of the
            pursuing vessel by 7+ points. For each turn (after the first) that a vessel maintains
            pursuit of another vessel, it gains a cumulative DM+1 to hit when attacking the vessel
            being pursued, up to a maximum of DM+4.
          </p>

          <h3 id="ram">Ram</h3>
          <p>
            Ramming is a potentially suicidal maneuver in which a pilot intentionally crashes his
            vessel into the hull of another vessel. This action may only be attempted at Close
            range, and if the ramming vessel is moving faster than the target. To successfully ram
            another vessel requires an opposed
            <a href="skills.html#piloting">Piloting</a> skill check between both vessels. A
            collision inflicts 1D6 damage for every point of difference in speed between the two
            vessels.
          </p>

          <h3 id="range-check">Range Check</h3>
          <p>
            The Navigator makes an opposed
            <a href="skills.html#navigation">Navigation</a> skill check with another vessel. The
            vessel with the highest result may elect to increase, decrease, or maintain the range
            between the vessels for the round.

          <h3 id="reload-weapons-system">Reload Weapons System</h3>
          <p>
            A crew member (usually the gunner) may spend the round reloading one spent missile rack,

            A ship with repair drones and the Auto-Repair software also makes one or two repair
            checks on the vessel's turn (unless it is being used to assist other repair attempts).
            The standard Auto-Repair software makes the check with a +1 DM. These are battlefield
            repairs only and will break down as soon as the battle is over unless repaired properly.

          <h3 id="sensor-targeting">Sensor Targeting</h3>
          <p>
            The sensors operator may attempt to spend the turn providing improved fire control and
            targeting data to the gunners, hopefully increasing their chances of hitting their
            targets. The sensors operator should make a Education-based
            <a href="skills.html#comms">Comms</a> skill check against the target's Sensor Jamming
            rating, for each vessel that is to targeted. If successful, all gunners on the vessel
            gain a DM+1 bonus to their attacks this turn, or a DM+2 on an Exceptional Success. When
            using missiles the initial attack gets this bonus – the individual missile to hit rolls
            do not benefit directly. Smart missiles are unaffected.

          <h3 id="miscellaneous-significant">Miscellaneous</h3>
          <p>
            A character may make a skill check or do something else as a significant action when
            such an action requires the character's full attention, concentration, complicated
            physical actions or some combination thereof. Any skill check with a time interval of
            1-6 minutes is simply considered a significant action during space combat.

          <h2 id="reactions">Reactions</h2>

            As in <a href="personal-combat.html">Personal Combat</a>, reactions are actions taken

          <h3 id="dodge-incoming-fire">Dodge Incoming Fire</h3>
          <p>
            To dodge, the pilot must make a
            <a href="skills.html#piloting">Piloting</a> check. If successful, the attack suffers a
            –2 DM.
          </p>

          <h3 id="fire-sand">Fire Sand</h3>
          <p>
            Turrets equipped with sandcasters can fire sand at incoming beam attacks. Each reaction
            spent on firing sand allows the gunner to make a
            <a href="skills.html#turret-weapons">Turret Weapons</a> roll. If successful the damage
            of each beam in the incoming attack is reduced by 1D6. Resolve each beam separately.
            Each firing of sand costs one canister of sand. Sand can also be directed against
            incoming boarding parties. If the sand attack is successful, each target in the boarding
            party takes 8D6 damage.
          </p>

          <h3 id="point-defense">Point Defense</h3>
          <p>
            Turret lasers can be used to destroy incoming missiles. The missiles can only be
            destroyed in the moments before they strike the spacecraft as they are too small and
            fast-moving to effectively target at greater ranges. The gunner must make a
            <a href="skills.html#turret-weapons">Turret Weapons</a> check against the missile. If
            successful, the missile is destroyed. A gunner may keep making
            <a href="skills.html#turret-weapons">Turret Weapons</a> checks against missiles until he
            misses an attack; each attack suffers a cumulative –1 penalty. Attacks may be directed
            against different incoming missiles. Point defense can also be used to attack incoming
            boarders in the same way.
          </p>

          <h3 id="trigger-screens">Trigger Screens</h3>
          <p>
            Screens can be activated as long as the commander or one of the gunners has the
            <a href="skills.html#screens">Screens</a> skill at Level 0 and the ship has the required
            screen type (nuclear against nuclear missiles and fusion guns; meson against meson
            guns). Screens reduce the damage from the attack by 2D6+the operator's
            <a href="skills.html#screens">Screens</a> skill. Nuclear dampers also remove the
            automatic radiation hit from nuclear missile attacks.

          <h2 id="other-actions">Other Actions</h2>
          <p>Other types of action can take place during space combat.</p>

          <h3 id="free-actions">Free Actions</h3>
          <p>
            Some actions are so fast on the scale of space combat that they do not even qualify as a
            minor action. A character can perform as many of these free actions as he likes in a
            turn, although if he performs several the Referee may require him to spend a minor or
            even a significant action on his various tasks.
          </p>

          <h3 id="extended-actions">Extended Actions</h3>
          <p>
            Some skill checks will take longer than a single combat turn to complete. Make a Timing
            roll for the task and then work out how many six minute combat turns it will take to
            complete. A character engaging in an extended action cannot do anything else but can
            abandon their action at any time and return to the normal Initiative order. A character
            who is hit by an attack while undertaking an extended action must make an 8+ roll using
            the skill in question with a negative DM equal to the amount of damage the attack causes
            (after armor). Failure indicates that this turn's work does not count towards the
            completion of the task. Failure by six or more (an Exceptional Failure) ruins the task
            and the character must start again.
          </p>

          <h3 id="delay">Delay</h3>
          <p>
            A vessel does not have to act when its turn comes up in the Initiative order. The
            Captain may decide to act at any later point during the turn, even interrupting
            another's actions to do so. When he acts, his Initiative is set to the count on which he
            acted. If the character has not acted by the end of the turn he may choose to act first
            in the next turn, effectively giving up his actions in the previous turn in exchange for
            an Initiative advantage. His new Initiative is set to one higher than that of the
            current first person in the order. When multiple characters are delaying and all wish to
            act first in the following turn, their Initiatives are all set to the same score and
            they act in order of Thrust as normal.
          </p>

          <h3 id="abstract-boarding-rules">Abstract Boarding Rules</h3>
          <p>
            In circumstances when the Referee may wish to resolve a boarding action without
            resorting to the personal combat rules, the following alternative method is suggested.
            On each round of a boarding action, the attacking Chief Security Officer (or Captain, if
            the CSO is down or not appointed) makes an opposed Intelligence-based
            <a href="skills.html#tactics">Tactics</a> skill check against the Chief Security Officer
            (or Captain, if the CSO is down or not appointed) of the defenders. The results of each
            round depend on who wins and the degree of success achieved by the winner of the opposed
            check, as outlined in the Abstract Boarding Resolution table.

            Unlike beam weapons, which travel at the speed of light and so hit the enemy vessel
            almost instantly, missile weapons take time to cross the gulf of space. Missiles travel
            at Thrust 10 towards their designated target and their position can either be tracked as
            additional craft in the battle or, for the sake of simplicity, they can be assumed to
            strike after a number of turns dependent on launch range, as shown in the Missile Launch

            their destination, so any target response must wait until then.

          <h2 id="damage">Damage</h2>
          <p>
            Systems can take a variable number of hits before being destroyed, depending on the
            system in question. A ship can endure one point of Hull damage per fifty tons, rounding
            down. A ship that runs out of Hull Damage will rapidly be incapacitated. A ship can
            endure one point of Structure damage per fifty tons, rounding down to a minimum of one.
            A ship that runs out of Structure breaks up and is completely destroyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The effects of damage are determined by subtracting the ship's armor from the damage
            rolled by the weapon, then consulting the Space Combat Damage table to determine the
            number of hits inflicted. Then roll on the Space Combat Hit Location table for each hit.
            Small craft use the Small craft column. Vessels of 100 tons or larger use the External
            Hit (Vessel) column until a ship has suffered enough damage to wipe out its Hull, and
            then uses the Internal Hit (Vessel) column. A double hit applies two hits to the same
            location. A triple hit applies three hits to the same location.
