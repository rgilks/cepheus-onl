          <h1>Chapter 11: Environments and Hazards</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            The following are common environmental hazards that are can be encountered in a Cepheus
            Engine game.
          </p>

          <h2 id="acid">Acid</h2>
          <p>
            Corrosive acids deal 1D6 damage per round of exposure, except in the case of total
            immersion (such as into a vat of acid), which deals 10D6 damage per round. An attack
            with acid, such as from a hurled vial or an animal's acidic spittle, counts as a round
            of exposure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fumes from most acids are poisonous. Those who come close enough to a large body of
            acid to dunk a creature in it must make an Average (+0) Endurance check or take 1D6
            point of damage. All such characters must make a second Average (+0) Endurance check one
            minute later or take another 1D6 point of damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creatures that are immune to acid's caustic properties might still drown in it if they
            are totally immersed and need to breathe. For more details, see
            <a href="#suffocation">Suffocation</a>.
          </p>

          <h2 id="carrying-capacity">Carrying Capacity</h2>
          <p>
            Strength determines how much weight characters can lift and how much any additional
            encumbrance slows them down. Characters carrying more than their Light Load suffer
            penalties.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Light Load</dt>
            <dd>
              As a light load, a character can life and carry up to twice their Strength
              characteristic score in kilograms without any penalties or difficulties. For example,
              an average character with a Strength score of 7 can carry up to 14 kilograms as a
              light load.
            </dd>
            <dt>Medium Load</dt>
            <dd>
              A medium load is considered to be twice a character's light load, or four times their
              Strength characteristic score in kilograms. Characters carrying a medium load suffer a
              DM-1 to all physically based checks, including skill checks. In addition, they move at
              75% of their base speed. For example, an average character with a Strength score of 7
              can carry up to 28 kilograms as a medium load. Such a character would suffer a DM-1 on
              all physical checks, and move at 4.5 meters, or 3 squares, per round.
            </dd>
            <dt>Heavy Load</dt>
            <dd>
              A heavy load is three times the character's light load, or six times their Strength
              characteristic score in kilograms. Characters can lift up to a heavy load overhead.
              Characters carrying a heavy load suffer a DM-2 to all physically based checks,
              including skill checks. In addition, they move at 75% of their base speed. For
              example, an average character with a Strength score of 7 can lift up to 42 kilograms
              as a heavy load. Such a character would suffer a DM-2 on all physical checks, and move
              at 4.5 meters, or 3 squares, per round.
            </dd>
            <dt>Maximum Load</dt>
            <dd>
              A character's maximum load is six times that of their light load, or twelve times
              their Strength score in kilograms. Characters can lift up to the maximum load off the
              ground, but can only stagger around with it. While overloaded in this way, characters
              cannot undertake any other actions, and can only move 1.5 meters, or 1 square, per
              round. For example, an average character with a Strength score of 7 can barely lift up
              to 94 kilograms as a maximum load. Such a character could perform no other actions
              while struggling with the load, except to move 1.5 meters per round.
            </dd>
            <dt>Push/Drag</dt>
            <dd>
              Characters can push or drag up to five times their heavy load weight, moving at half
              their normal speed. Favorable conditions (smooth ground, dragging a slick object)
              double these numbers, and bad circumstances (broken ground, pushing an object that
              snags) can reduce them to one-half or less.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h3 id="gravity-and-carrying-capacity">Gravity and Carrying Capacity</h3>
          <p>
            The above assumes the character is operating at a standard 1.0 gravity. When operating
            under a different gravitational pull (or within an artificial gravity set to a
            non-standard value), simply divide a character's load weight by the gravitational pull
            to determine the new load weight value under those conditions.
          </p>

          <h2 id="diseases">Diseases</h2>
          <p>
            Diseases reduce a character's Characteristics, usually Endurance. The character must
            make an Endurance check with the listed DM to resist the effects of the disease. If the
            character fails the Endurance check then he takes the listed damage and must make
            another Endurance check a few hours or days later, depending on the interval of the
            disease. Once an Endurance check has been passed, the character has fought off the
            disease.

          <h3 id="catching-on-fire">Catching on Fire</h3>
          <p>
            Characters touching a fire source might find their clothes, hair, or equipment on fire.
            Those at risk of catching fire are allowed a Difficult (-2) Dexterity check to avoid
            this fate. If a character's clothes or hair catch fire, he takes 2D6 damage immediately.
            In each subsequent round, the burning character must make another Difficult (-2)
            Dexterity check. Failure means he takes another 2D6 damage that round. Success means the
            fire has gone out.
          </p>
          <p>
            A character on fire may automatically extinguish the flames by jumping into enough water
            to douse himself, spraying himself down with a fire extinguisher, vent all atmosphere or
            otherwise smother the flames. If the character has no such means, rolling on the ground
            or smothering the fire with cloaks or the like permits the character a DM+2 on his next
            Dexterity check.
          </p>

          <h2 id="falling-and-gravity">Falling and Gravity</h2>
          <p>
            A character who falls on a 1-gravity world suffers 1D6 damage per two meters fallen.
            High- or low-gravity worlds will increase or decrease the damage. Look up the size code
            for the world and the gravity level associated with it and multiply the falling damage
            by the gravity number.

            much faster and often have a wider range of effects. Most poisons do not have an
            interval but apply their damage immediately.

          <h2 id="radiation-exposure">Radiation Exposure</h2>
          <p>
            Radiation exposure is measured in rads. Once a character has absorbed a certain number
            of rads, he will suffer certain effects. One problem with radiation exposure is that
            while physical symptoms can be treated and may heal, the radiation never goes away. The
            character's rads must be tracked. Further exposure adds to what the character is already
            carrying around until a deadly level is reached. Accumulated rads can be removed using
            anti-radiation drugs. Characters exposed to a radiation weapon will receive a one-time
            dose of radiation. Entering a radioactive area or being exposed to a leak or solar flare
            will cause exposure each round or hour. Every time a character experiences exposure to
            radiation, they must check to see if they've come down with radiation sickness, as
            outlined on the Radiation Effects table. The character must make an Endurance check at
            the listed DM, and if he fails, he takes the damage listed and must make another
            Endurance check after the listed interval has passed. This cycle continues until the
            character succeeds at an Endurance check.
          </p>
          <p>
            At any Radiation Level below Mild, the character is treated as having a lower Endurance
            characteristic score. If a character should accumulate enough rads to move to a higher
            Radiation Level, the new Endurance characteristic score immediately goes into effect. On
            the other hand, if a character moves to a lower Radiation Level, such as through
            anti-radiation drugs, the character heals the difference between the former level and
            the current level over time, as if it were physical damage. If a character's Effective
            endurance falls below zero, the character goes unconscious and cannot recover until
            their Radiation Level drops enough to allow healing to take place.

          <h2 id="starvation-and-dehydration">Starvation and Dehydration</h2>
          <p>
            Characters might find themselves without food or water and with no means to obtain them.
            In normal climates, a character needs at least a gallon of fluids and about a pound of
            food per day to avoid starvation. In very hot climates, characters need two or three
            times as much water to avoid dehydration.
          </p>
          <p>
            A character can go without water for a number of hours equal to 20 plus twice his
            Endurance score. After this time, the character must make a Routine (+2) Endurance check
            each hour (DM-1 for each previous check) or take 1D6 damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            A character can go without food for 3 days, in growing discomfort. After this time, the
            character must make a Routine (+2) Endurance check each day (DM-1 for each previous
            check) or take 1D6 damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Damage from thirst or starvation cannot be recovered until the character gets food or
            water.
          </p>

          <h2 id="suffocation">Suffocation</h2>
          <p>
            In an area where sufficient oxygen is not long available, such as on board a starship
            without life support, a character begins to suffocate, suffering 1D6 damage each minute.
            A character who is utterly without air (such as one who is being smothered or strangled,
            or who has been dumped out an airlock) suffers 1D6 damage each round instead.
          </p>

          <h2 id="vacuum-exposure">Vacuum Exposure</h2>
          <p>
            Beings exposed to the airless cold of space are not immediately doomed. Contrary to
            popular belief, characters exposed to vacuum do not immediately freeze or explode, and
            their blood does not boil in their veins. While space is very cold, heat does not
            transfer away from a body that quickly. The real danger comes from suffocation and
            ionizing radiation.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the third round of exposure to vacuum, a character must succeed on a Very Difficult
            (-4) Endurance check each round or suffer from aeroembolism ("the bends"). A character
            that fails the check experiences excruciating pain as small air bubbles form in its
            bloodstream; such a character is considered stunned and generally unable to move, and
            remains so until returned to normal atmospheric pressure. A character that fails the
            check with an Exceptional Failure (Effect -6 or lower) falls unconscious.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real danger of vacuum comes from suffocation, though holding one's breath in vacuum
            damages the lungs. Treat anyone trapped in a hard vacuum as being utterly without air
            under the
            <a href="#suffocation">Suffocation</a> rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfiltered radiation bombards any character trapped in the vacuum of space without
            protective gear. A character exposed to this ionizing radiation suffers from severe
            sunburn as well as the effects equivalent to a high level irradiated area. See
            <a href="#radiation-exposure">Radiation Exposure</a> for specific details.
