          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            Welcome to the
            <b><i>Cepheus Engine Vehicle Design System (VDS)</i></b
            >, which outlines the core vehicle design rules for the <b><i>Cepheus Engine</i></b
            >, a Classic Era Science Fiction 2D6-Based Open Gaming Sytem. The first chapter shows
            you how to create vehicles for your own exciting science fiction adventures, and later
            chapters provide a series of common vehicles for use in your Cepheus Engine games.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The system is inspired by the design system outlined in
            <a href="ship-design-and-construction.html">Chapter 8: Ship Design and Construction</a>
            from the Cepheus Engine Core Rules. Hopefully, Referees and players alike will find
            familiarity with one system helps with creating vessels in the other system.
          </p>

          <h2>On Creating a Playable Level of Detail</h2>
          <p>
            While no vehicle design system can successfully duplicate every possible Real World™
            example, the Cepheus Engine Vehicle Design System (VDS) does make an effort to
            accommodate as many designs as possible. At the end of the day, however, that the goal
            of this design system is to create playable game statistics for vehicles, not recreate
            modern vehicles down to the nuts and bolts of muzzle velocities and surface areas, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            As such, some generalizations have to be assumed, as this design system aims to create a
            playable level of detail while still empowering Referees and players to create
            interesting vehicles. Weapons are not broken down by caliber or bore size. Instead,
            armament options for light and heavy weapons allow for designing weapons of differing
            power levels compared to one another. Drive options for fuel efficiency and agility are
            other tools to help create differences in similar vehicles from a comparison
            perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that ultimately, this design system is yours to do with as you will. If you
            can’t build what you want with it as is, feel free to change it or extend it to meet
            your own personal needs. If you are a player, however, please be sure to get your
            Referee’s approval first.
          </p>

          <h2 id="important terms">Important Terms</h2>
          <p>
            The Cepheus Engine Vehicle Design System uses certain words and abbreviations throughout
            the rules system. In order properly understand the Cepheus Engine Vehicle Design System
            rules, both players and Referees should become familiar with these terms. The following
            words, phrases and abbreviations are commonly used in this supplement:

            <dt>Meson Accelerator</dt>
            <dd>
              A particle accelerator that projects a stream of mesons, calculated to decay while

            <dt>Space</dt>
            <dd>
              Within the vehicle design system, a space is a measure of volume displacement that is
              approximately equal to 1.167 cubic meters or 1.167 kiloliters. For the sake of
              simplicity, the vehicle design system assumes that there are 12 spaces to a
              displacement ton. The rest of the tonnage is used for miscellaneous things, such as
              wires, ducts, rope, support beams, and other items as appropriate to the tech level
              and purpose of the vehicle.
            </dd>

            <dd>
              General term for a vessel that displaces 20 tons or less, and generally restricted to
              operation on a single world. The design system in this supplement is intended to
              create vessels that meet this description.
            </dd>
            <dt>Vessel</dt>
            <dd>

          <h2>New Skill</h2>
          <p>
            The Cepheus Engine VDS introduces a new skill, Airship, which is considered part of the
            Aircraft cascade skill.
          </p>

          <h3>Airship</h3>
          <p>
            This skill grants the ability to properly maneuver and perform basic, routine
            maintenance on balloons and airships of any sort. Such vehicles attain lift from a body
            of gas that is lighter than the surrounding atmosphere.
          </p>

          <h2>Vehicle-Mounted Weapon Ranges</h2>
          <p>
            Some vehicle-mounted weapons use the
            <a href="personal-combat.html#range">range classifications</a>
            outlined in the Cepheus Engine core rules. However, many do not. The following table
            combines the standard weapon ranges and the weapon ranges used by the new weapons
            outlined in the Cepheus Engine Vehicle Design System. The following abbreviations are
            used to make the table easier to read:
