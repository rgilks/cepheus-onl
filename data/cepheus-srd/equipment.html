            The following section lists examples of common equipment that adventurers may want.
            Aside from armor and weapons, each listing notes the object's name and a basic
            description. The technological level indicates local technology required to manufacture
            something with the capabilities listed. Price and weight are for an item manufactured by
            an interstellar society of tech level 10-15; items produced at lower tech levels will
            probably be bulkier and more expensive. An item with no weight or size given can be
            carried or worn without difficulty. Additional lines of explanation are given where
            considered necessary.

          <h2 id="currency">Currency</h2>
          <p>
            The Credit (Cr) is the standard unit of currency in Cepheus Engine. Larger denominations
            include the KiloCredit (KCr; 1,000 Credits) and the MegaCredit (MCr; 1,000,000 Credits).
          </p>

          <h2 id="armor">Armor</h2>
          <p>
            Armor reduces the amount of damage a character takes from a hit, based on the type of
            armor worn. The armor rating for a set of armor is equal to the amount of damage reduced
            by the armor when you are hit in combat. A hit with Effect 6+ always inflicts at least
            one point of damage, regardless of the target's armor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise noted, only one type of armor can be worn at a time. Resolve damage
            from the outside in – damage that gets through the outer layer of armor is next applied
            to the inner layer.

            <dt>Armor Rating (AR)</dt>
            <dd>
              The amount of damage reduced by the armor when an attack strikes the character. When
              two values are listed separated by a slash, the number to the left of the slash
              represents the armor rating against all attacks except lasers, while the number to the
              right of the slash represents the armor rating against laser attacks.

              Some armors have a required skill. A character suffers the usual unskilled penalty

          <h3>Armor Descriptions</h3>

            <dt>Ablat (TL 9)</dt>
            <dd>
              A cheap alternative to Reflec, ablat armor is made from a material that ablates
              (vaporizes) when hit by laser fire. Each laser hit on ablat reduces its armor value
              (versus lasers) by one, but the armor is cheap and easily replaceable.
            </dd>
            <dt>Battle Dress (TL 13)</dt>
            <dd>
              The ultimate personal armor, battle dress is a powered form of combat armor. The
              servomotors vastly increase the user's speed and strength, boosting his Strength and
              Dexterity by +4 while wearing the armor. Damage to the wearer's characteristics is
              calculated as normal, but the values from the armor are used for all other purposes
              such as hand to hand damage or skill checks. The suit has a built-in Model 2 computer
              running an Expert Tactics-2 program to give tactical advice and updates and is
              commonly outfitted with numerous upgrades. The suit is fully enclosed, with a six-hour
              air supply and gives full protection against environmental hazards – including NBC
              shielding – as if it was an HEV suit.
            </dd>
            <dt>Cloth (TL 7)</dt>
            <dd>
              A heavy duty body suit tailored from ballistic cloth. The fabric absorbs impact energy
              and spreads it over the body, which can result in bruising. However, cloth armor is
              highly useful and versatile – it can be effectively concealed under normal clothing
              although observers making an Investigate or Recon check at 8+ will notice something
              unusual.
            </dd>
            <dt>Combat Armor (TL 11)</dt>
            <dd>
              This full-body suit is used by the military and not generally available on the open
              market, although those with military or criminal contacts can obtain it without much
              difficulty. It is issued to troop units and mercenary battalions. Combat armor
              protects from hard vacuum in the same way as a vacc suit and provides life support for
              six hours.
            </dd>
            <dt>Hostile Environment Vacc Suit (TL 8)</dt>
            <dd>
              Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would
              be insufficient, such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases,
              extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer serious physical
              danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere. HEV suits provide all the life
              support offered by a normal vacc suit (for six hours) but are also impervious to
              flames, intense radiation such as that found at nuclear blast sites (decreasing
              radiation exposure by 180 rads), and high pressure environments like undersea
              trenches.
            </dd>
            <dt>Jack (TL 1)</dt>
            <dd>
              A natural or synthetic leather jacket or body suit covering the torso and upper arms
              and legs.
            </dd>
            <dt>Mesh (TL 6)</dt>
            <dd>
              A jacket or body suit lined with a flexible metal or plastic mesh that gives it added
              protection against bullets.
            </dd>
            <dt>Reflec (TL 10)</dt>
            <dd>
              Reflec armor is a flexible plastic suit with layers of reflective material and
              heat-dispersing gel. It is highly effective against lasers, but provides no protection
              against other attacks. Reflec can be worn with other armor.
            </dd>
            <dt>Vacc Suit (TL 8)</dt>
            <dd>
              The vacc suit or space suit is the spacer's best friend, providing life support and
              protection when in space. A vacc suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection
              from the extremes of temperature, low pressure and radiation typically found in a hard
              vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads), for six hours.

              there are natural spices and other rare compounds that have comparable effects at all

              Must be administered before or immediately after (within ten minutes) radiation
              exposure. They absorb up to 100 rads per dose. A character may only use anti-rad drugs

              This drug increases reaction time and improves the body's ability to cope with trauma,
              aiding the user in combat. A character using a combat drug adds +4 to his initiative
              total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge
              once each round with no effect on his initiative score and reduces all damage suffered
              by two points. The drug kicks in twenty seconds (four rounds) after injection, and
              lasts around ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user is fatigued.

              for the user is actually two months. Fast drug is normally used to prolong life

              poisons or diseases, or at the very least give a positive DM towards resisting them.
              If the wrong drug is administered, treat it as a Difficult (–2 DM) poison with a

            <dd>
              Also known as 'Slow Drug', this drug boosts the user's reaction time to superhuman
              levels. A character using slow drug in combat adds +8 to his initiative total at the
              start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge up to twice
              each round with no effect on his initiative score. The drug kicks in 45 seconds (eight
              rounds) after ingestion or injection and lasts for around ten minutes. When the drug
              wears off, the user's system crashes. He suffers 2D6 points of damage and is
              exhausted.

              without an intervening period of sleep, the character suffers two points of damage the

              A holographic projector is a toaster-sized box that, when activated, creates a
              three-dimensional image in the space around it or nearby – the range is approximately
              three meters in all directions. The image can be given pre-programmed animations
              within a limited range and the projector includes speakers for making sound. The
              projected holograms are obviously not real so this device is mostly used for
              communication. The TL 12 version can produce holograms real enough to fool anyone who
              fails an Intelligence check (made upon first seeing the hologram), at double the cost,
              and the TL 13 version can produce holograms that are true-to-life images, at ten times
              the cost.

          <h2 id="robots-and-drones">Robots and Drones</h2>
          <p>
            Robots are iconic to science fiction. This section describes the robots and drones
            commonly available in a Cepheus Engine campaign. A robot has an Intellect program
            running, allowing it to make decisions independently, while drones are remote-controlled
            by a character with the <a href="skills.html#comms">Comms</a> skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Robots and drones operate in combat like characters but take damage as if they were
            vehicles. They have Hull and Structure characteristics instead of an Endurance
            characteristic, and an Endurance DM of 0. Any robot running an Intellect program has an
            Intelligence and Education score. Drones have neither. A robot's Education
            characteristic is representative of the information programmed into it and even low-end
            robots can have high Education scores. Most robots have Social Standing characteristics
            of 0 as they are not social creations but there are some exceptions, usually high-end
            models running advanced Intellect programs. Drones do not have Social Standing but in
            cases where they are used to engage in diplomacy or other social intercourse the
            operator can use his own Social Standing score.

              floating on calm water, and has a suite of built-in sensors and communications
              equipment (usually a laser transceiver) making it ideal for exploration. An ATV has a

              many military forces. The turret-mounted fusion gun is a vehicle-mounted version of
              the TL 15 FGMP and uses the same 'serious firepower' rules. Advanced containment
              systems mean that it does not leak radiation with each shot in the same way as the
              man-portable version. Like the air/raft, the G/Carrier can reach orbit (taking a
              number of hours equal to the world's Size code).

            <dt>Grav Belt</dt>
            <dd>
              A grav belt resembles a parachute harness, and is fitted with artificial gravity
              modules allowing the wearer to fly. The internal battery can operate for a maximum of
              four hours before needing to be recharged. At TL 15, the battery can operate for 12
              hours before charging. Options cannot be added to the grav belt.

            <dt>Grav Floater</dt>
            <dd>
              A grav floater is a forerunner of the grav belt, a platform upon which a single person
              can stand and be carried along. It cannot achieve any great speed but can, like an
              air/raft, achieve any altitude up to orbit (taking a number of hours equal to the
              world's Size code).

            <dd>
              An autopilot has a Model 1 computer specialized to run Intellect/1 and an Expert/1 in
              an appropriate skill and specialty. This will be in addition to any other computers
              installed. An autopilot is often mandatory on cheaper commercial models. In many areas
              (primarily urban) they are required to be in use. Higher Law Level polities may
              require a slave modification to the autopilot for centralized and/or emergency traffic
              control. Cr3,000.

              A vehicle which is sealed can be equipped for extended life support, which increases
              the duration to 18 hours per person. Costs another 10% of the base cost of the
              vehicle.
            </dd>
            <dt>Heavy Armor</dt>
            <dd>Increasing the armor of a vehicle by 5 adds 25% to the cost of the vehicle.</dd>

            <dt>Bayonet</dt>
            <dd>
              A small knife-like weapon similar to a dagger, frequently attached to a rifle. When
              not attached to a rifle, the bayonet performs as a dagger.
            </dd>
            <dt>Blade</dt>
            <dd>
              A hybrid knife weapon with a heavy, flat two-edged blade nearly 300mm in length, and
              (often, but not always) a semi-basket handguard. Because of the bulk of the handguard,
              it is generally carried in a belt scabbard. Blades are as much survival tools as
              weapons, and are often found in emergency kits, lifeboats etc.

            <dt>Broadsword</dt>
            <dd>
              The largest of the sword weapons, also called the two-handed sword because it requires
              both hands to swing. The blade is extremely heavy, two-edged, and about 1000 to 1200mm
              in length. The hilt is relatively simple, generally a cross-piece only, with little
              basketwork or protection. When carried, the broadsword is worn in a metal scabbard
              attached to the belt; less frequently, the scabbard is worn on the back, and the
              broadsword is drawn over the shoulder.
            </dd>
            <dt>Cudgel</dt>
            <dd>
              A basic stick used as a weapon. Easily obtained from standing trees or through the use
              of an unloaded long gun such as a rifle or carbine (laser weapons are too delicate to
              be used as cudgels). Length: 1000 to 2000mm.
            </dd>
            <dt>Cutlass</dt>
            <dd>
              A heavy, flat-bladed, single-edged weapon featuring a full basket hilt to protect the
              hand. The cutlass is the standard shipboard blade weapon and sometimes kept in lockers
              on the bulkhead near important locations; when worn, a belt scabbard is used. Blade
              length varies from 600 to 900mm.
            </dd>
            <dt>Dagger</dt>
            <dd>
              A small knife weapon with a flat, two-edged blade approximately 200mm in length.
              Daggers are usually carried in a belt sheath, or less frequently concealed in a boot
              sheath or strapped to the forearm. Daggers are usually as much a tool as a last-resort
              weapon of defense, and worn constantly. Each weighs 250 grams; that weight, however,
              does not count against the weight load of the character as the weapon is worn
              constantly and comfortably.
            </dd>
            <dt>Foil</dt>
            <dd>
              Also known as the rapier, this weapon is a light, sword-like weapon with a pointed,
              edged blade 800mm in length, and a basket or cup hilt to protect the hand. Foils are
              worn in scabbards attached to the belt.
            </dd>
            <dt>Halberd</dt>
            <dd>
              A two-handed pole weapon having an axe-like blade and a steel spike mounted on the end
              of a long shaft. Length: 2500mm.
            </dd>
            <dt>Pike</dt>
            <dd>
              A two-handed weapon with a pointed steel or iron head on a long wooden shaft. Length:
              3000 to 4000mm.
            </dd>
            <dt>Spear</dt>
            <dd>
              A weapon with a long shaft and a pointed tip, typically of metal, used for thrusting
              or throwing. Length: 3000mm.
            </dd>
            <dt>Sword</dt>
            <dd>
              The standard long-edged weapon, featuring a flat, two-edged blade. It may or may not
              have a basket hilt or hand protector. A scabbard to carry the sword may be attached to
              the belt, or to straps (or a sash) over the shoulder. Blade length may vary from 700
              to 950mm.

              charge. Normally the rifle fires bursts of three rounds per pull of the trigger, but
              may be adjusted to fire single rounds.

            <dd>
              A highly refined and tuned version of the rifle, capable of full automatic fire as
              well as semi-automatic shots. Normally, the automatic rifle fires bursts of four
              bullets for each pull of the trigger. It may be switched to semi-automatic fire at the
              end of a combat round, after all firing, in which case it is treated as a rifle until
              switched back to burst mode. Ammunition and magazines are identical to those used for
              the rifle.

            <dt>Auto Pistol</dt>
            <dd>
              Also referred to as a Semi-Automatic Pistol, Automatic Pistol or just a Pistol, the
              auto pistol is a basic repeating handgun. One cartridge is fired for each pull of the
              trigger. Auto pistol ammunition is interchangeable with submachinegun ammunition
              (although magazines are not). Preloaded magazines may be inserted into an empty
              pistol, but require a reload action to complete.
            </dd>
            <dt>Body Pistol</dt>
            <dd>
              A small, non-metallic semiautomatic pistol designed to evade detection by most weapon
              detectors. One cartridge is fired for each pull of the trigger. Pre-loaded magazines
              may be inserted into the pistol when it is empty, requiring a reload action to do so.
              Body pistol ammunition is not interchangeable with the ammunition for any other types
              of guns.

            <dt>Bow</dt>
            <dd>
              A stout but supple piece of wood carved to a specific shape and strung with a piece of
              cord, string or gut to increase tension. The string is pulled back and released to
              hurl an arrow long distances with surprising force. At higher technology levels, bows
              are modified with additional strings and pulley systems to add accuracy and power.
            </dd>
            <dt>Carbine</dt>
            <dd>
              A short type of rifle firing a small caliber round. A magazine containing ten rounds
              is inserted into the underside of the carbine ahead of the trigger guard or behind the
              handgrip (this configuration is referred to as "Bullpup", and in some localities
              carbines may be referred to as Bullpups), and one round is fired with each pull of the
              trigger. Replacement of an empty magazine takes a reload action. Carbine ammunition is
              not interchangeable with any other type of ammunition. In essence, a carbine is a
              short rifle, firing a cartridge of smaller, lighter caliber. A sling usually allows
              the carbine to be carried on the shoulder, out of the way.

            <dt>Crossbow</dt>
            <dd>
              A horizontal bow set into a mechanical firing mechanism and stronger-than-normal pull,
              crossbows are very powerful weapons that are very time consuming to reload. At higher
              technology levels, crossbows are built with crank and pulley systems that make the
              weapons easier to reload, even self-loading at TL9. Reloading a TL2 crossbow takes 6
              minor actions, at TL4 this is reduced to 3 minor actions.

            <dt>Gauss Rifle</dt>
            <dd>
              The ultimate development of the slug thrower, the gauss rifle generates an
              electromagnetic field along the length of the barrel which accelerates a bullet to
              high velocities. The round itself consists of a dense armor piercing core surrounded
              by a softer metal covering, ending in a hollow point, giving the round excellent
              stopping power and good armor penetration.
            </dd>
            <dt>Laser Carbine</dt>
            <dd>
              A lightweight version of the laser rifle, firing high energy bolts using current from
              a backpack battery/power pack. The laser carbine fires a 2mm beam of energy, aimed by
              integrated optic sights. The power pack is capable of producing 50 shots before it
              requires recharging. Recharging requires at least eight hours connected to a
              high-energy source. The laser carbine is connected to the power pack by a heavy-duty
              cable.
            </dd>
            <dt>Laser Pistol</dt>
            <dd>
              A pistol equivalent of the laser carbine, though still dependent on an external power
              pack.
            </dd>
            <dt>Laser Rifle</dt>
            <dd>
              The standard high energy weapon, firing energy bolts in the same manner as the laser
              carbine. Heavier, the laser rifle is also capable of longer sustained action, and is
              somewhat sturdier. The power pack can provide 100 shots before recharging. As in the
              laser carbine, the laser rifle is connected to the power pack by a heavy-duty cable.
              Power packs are not interchangeable between the two weapons, however.

            <dt>Revolver</dt>
            <dd>
              An early handgun, the revolver fires 9mm bullets with characteristics similar to those
              used by the automatic pistol but not interchangeable with them. No magazine is used:
              six cartridges are inserted into the revolver individually. Reloading takes two combat
              rounds, or one combat round if the individual foregoes the benefit of evasion.
            </dd>
            <dt>Rifle</dt>
            <dd>
              The standard military arm, firing a 7mm, 10 gram bullet at a velocity of approximately
              900 meters per second. Longer and heavier than a carbine, it is also more effective.
              Standard equipment includes provisions for attaching a bayonet and telescopic sights,
              and a shoulder sling. A twenty-round magazine is attached to the front of the trigger
              guard, and one round is fired with each pull of the trigger. Replacement of the empty
              magazine requires a reload action. Rifle ammunition may also be used in automatic
              rifles; rifle and auto rifle magazines are interchangeable, and weigh the same.
            </dd>
            <dt>Shotgun</dt>
            <dd>
              The basic weapon for maximum shock effect without regard to accuracy. The shotgun has
              an 18mm diameter barrel and fires shells containing either six 7mm bullets, or one
              hundred and thirty 3mm pellets. In each case, the projectiles weigh a total of 30
              grams. Velocity for the projectiles is about 350 meters per second. A cylindrical
              magazine containing 10 shells is inserted under the barrel and parallel to it;
              cartridges are then fed automatically into the shotgun for firing. Reloading consists
              of replacing the cylindrical magazine and takes two combat rounds. One shot is fired
              for each pull of the trigger. Magazines measure approximately 350mm long by 20mm in
              diameter and are quite clumsy to carry. Shotguns are equipped with a sling for
              carrying.

            <dt>Submachinegun (SMG)</dt>
            <dd>
              A small automatic weapon designed to fire pistol ammunition. Magazines holding 30
              cartridges are inserted into the weapon forward of the trigger guard or in the pistol
              grip, depending on the design. The gun fires a burst of four rounds per pull of the
              trigger. Replacement of an empty magazine requires one combat round. Submachinegun
              ammunition (but not magazines) is interchangeable with autopistol ammunition. Most
              submachineguns are equipped with slings for ease of carrying. Some are small enough to
              be carried in a shoulder or hip holster.

            <dt>Grenade Launcher</dt>
            <dd>
              An underslung RAM grenade launcher can be added to any rifle. This grenade launcher
              has a magazine of one grenade, cannot fire on automatic and takes four minor actions
              to reload.

            <dt>Gyrostabilizer</dt>
            <dd>
              Stabilizers can be added to any weapon with recoil, reducing the recoil penalty by one

            <dt>Secure Weapon</dt>
            <dd>
              A secure weapon requires authentication in some fashion (scanning the user's DNA or
              iris patterns, entering a password, transmission of an unlocking code from a comm)
              before it can be fired.
            </dd>
            <dt>Shoulder Stocks</dt>
            <dd>
              It is possible to produce a shoulder stock which may be attached temporarily to a
              pistol or revolver, resulting in a crude carbine arrangement and some greater accuracy
              at longer ranges. When firing a pistol or revolver equipped with such a stock, treat
              the weapon as ranged (shotgun). The overall length of the pistol is increased by the
              length of the stock, and the pistol cannot be holstered. Attaching the stock (or
              detaching it) requires five combat rounds.
            </dd>
            <dt>Silencer</dt>
            <dd>
              A silencer can be added to any slug thrower with ROF 4 or less, masking the sound
              produced by firing. (–4 DM to detect.)
            </dd>
            <dt>Telescopic Sights</dt>
            <dd>
              High-quality telescopic sights for attachment to weapons, for increasing their
              accuracy, especially at longer ranges. A weapon equipped with such sights gains an
              extra +1 DM bonus to any attack that has been aimed. Telescopic sights are delicate,
              however, and may be jarred out of alignment by any violent action (such as being left
              untended in a moving truck, a close explosion, or being dropped) on an 8+ on 2D6. When
              the sights go out of adjustment, the firer will always miss.

              Smoke grenades create a thick cloud of smoke six meters in radius, centered on the
              location of the grenade. This smoke imposes a –2 DM on all attacks within or through
              the cloud (doubled for laser weapons). Smoke dissipates in 1D6x3 rounds, although high
              winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time.

              Stun weapons, such as stun grenades, are non-lethal and do not inflict normal damage.
              A character within six meters of a stun grenade detonation must make an Endurance
              check with a negative DM equal to the damage (after armor is subtracted). If this
              Endurance check is failed the character is knocked unconscious. If the Endurance check
              is successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon and the stun damage is
              ignored.

              It includes a gravity suspension system to reduce its inertia, making it easier to use
              than the PGMP (minimum Strength 9) and fires what amounts to a directed nuclear
              explosion. Those without radiation protection who are nearby when a FGMP is fired will
              suffer a lethal dose of radiation – each firing of an FGMP emits 2D6 x 20 rads, which
              will affect everyone within the immediate vicinity.

            <dt>Grenade Launcher</dt>
            <dd>
              Grenade launchers are used to fire grenades over long distances. Grenades for a
              grenade launcher are not interchangeable with handheld grenades.

            <dt>PGMP (Plasma Gun, Man-Portable)</dt>
            <dd>
              It is so heavy and bulky that it can only be used easily by a trooper with a Strength
              of 12 or more – usually attained by wearing battle dress. Every point by which a
              user's Strength falls short is a –1 DM on any attack rolls made with it.

            <dt>RAM Grenade Launcher</dt>
            <dd>
              Rocket Assisted Multi-purpose grenade launchers have a longer range and are capable of
              firing up to three grenades with a single attack. This uses the rules for firing on
              full auto; unlike other automatic weapons, a RAM grenade launcher cannot fire in burst
              mode. It takes two minor actions to reload a RAM grenade launcher. Grenades for a RAM
              grenade launcher are not interchangeable with handheld grenades.
            </dd>
            <dt>Rocket Launcher</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                To counteract the recoil of the weapon, a rocket launcher channels exhaust backwards
                in an explosive back blast. Anyone up to 1.5 meters behind a rocket launcher when it
                fires takes 3D6 damage from the burning gasses. Vehicle-mounted rocket launchers
                lose this side-effect as a vehicle is a more stable firing platform than a person.
                It takes three minor actions to reload a rocket launcher.
              </p>
              <p>
                The rockets presented are high-explosive models. Do not add the Effect of the attack
                roll to their damage but apply that damage to everything within six meters of the
                impact point. A rocket that misses has a 50% chance (4+ on 1D6) of detonating upon
                impact with the ground (6 – Effect meters away in a random direction). Otherwise it
                will miss completely and leave the battlefield without striking anything or
                detonating.
