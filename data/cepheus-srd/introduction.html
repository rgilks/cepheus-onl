          <p class="lead">
            Welcome to the <b><i>Cepheus Engine System Reference Document</i></b
            >, which outlines the core rules used by a Classic Era Science Fiction 2D6-Based Open
            Gaming System. This Introduction provides you with an overview of what the Cepheus
            Engine is and how it works, while the later chapters show you how to create characters
            and embark on your own exciting science fiction adventures.
          </p>

          <h2>What Is Roleplaying?</h2>
          <p>
            If you are new to roleplaying, you might be asking yourself, "What is a roleplaying
            game?"
          </p>
          <p>
            A roleplaying game (sometimes abbreviated as RPG) is a game in which players assume the
            roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out
            these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of
            structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games
            succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines, such as the
            Cepheus Engine rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            A session of Cepheus Engine play is conducted through discussion. One player, the
            Referee, usually arbitrates any decision based on the rules and presents the setting of
            the game, while each of the other players plays the role of a single character.
            Together, the Referee and players create a story, much like the way many of us used to
            create stories playing games of make believe as young children, except with more dice
            and more structure.
          </p>

          <h2>What Is The Cepheus Engine?</h2>
          <p>
            The Cepheus Engine is simply a set of rules for conducting a game based on classic
            science fiction. Within its pages, you will find rules on creating characters, resolving
            tasks, fighting other creatures and engaging in huge space battles, building worlds,
            enjoy the risks of interstellar speculative trading, exploring new worlds, and a host of
            other diverse activities. Although no rules set can be complete, the Cepheus Engine
            attempts to provide enough rules to allow you to create almost any science fiction
            adventure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Cepheus Engine is inspired by classic science fiction games from the early days of
            roleplaying, and shares a lot of similarities with these gaming systems. Material from
            these older rules sets and those created under the Cepheus Engine are mutually
            compatible with only a minimum of adjustments required.
          </p>
          <p>
            To play, you need a copy of the Cepheus Engine rules; several six-sided dice, available
            at game and hobby stores (you'll need two at a minimum, but more is better); and a
            pencil and some paper.
          </p>

          <h2 id="core-task-resolution-system">The Core Task Resolution System</h2>
          <p>
            The Cepheus Engine uses a core task resolution system to resolve actions. Whenever your
            character attempts any action with a chance of failure, do the following:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Roll two six-sided dice (abbreviated 2d6).</li>
            <li>
              Add any relevant modifiers (for things like characteristics, skills, difficulty and
              circumstances).
            </li>
            <li>
              If the result equals or exceeds 8, the action succeeds. If the result is lower than 8,
              the action fails.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This simple system is used for nearly everything in the Cepheus Engine, with variations
            based on the modifiers added to a roll and the effects of success and failure.
          </p>

          <h2 id="referee">The Referee</h2>
          <p>
            Within the Cepheus Engine rules, one of the players is asked to assume the mantle of
            Referee. The Referee is the person who will act as an organizer, officiant for questions
            regarding rules, arbitrator, and moderator for a Cepheus Engine gaming session, or an
            ongoing Cepheus Engine campaign. The role of the Referee is to weave the other
            participants' player-character stories together, control the non-player aspects of the
            game, create environments in which the players can interact, and solve any player
            disputes.
          </p>

          <h2 id="characters">The Characters</h2>
          <p>
            A player character or playable character (PC) is a fictional character in a Cepheus
            Engine game whose actions are directly controlled by a player of the game rather than
            the rules of the game. The characters that are not controlled by a player are called
            non-player characters (NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled
            by the Referee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the Cepheus Engine rules as guidelines, a player will create a character
            reflecting the sort of role they'd like to have in the game. The character is usually of
            a certain race (depending on those available with the Referee's universe) and possesses
            a unique combination of skills and levels of expertise. The attributes of a character is
            given as numerical values which can change as the gamer progresses, and characters grow
            and develop over the course of their adventures.
          </p>

          <h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
          <p>
            All characters have certain basic characteristics that define what they are capable of
            doing. These characteristics are Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence,
            Education, and Social Standing. They each have a numeric characteristic score, averaging
            7 for a normally capable human. Higher characteristic scores grant bonuses (+1 or more)
            on task resolution checks, while lower characteristic scores grant penalties (as low as
            -2). As part of creating your character, you decide how strong, smart, and tough your
            character is by choosing the appropriate characteristic scores. See
            <a href="character-creation.html">Chapter 1: Character Creation</a>
            for more information.
          </p>

          <h2 id="careers">Careers</h2>
          <p>
            As a part of their development, characters follow certain life paths called careers. The
            Cepheus Engine provides a variety of career options for characters to pursue, which
            opens up opportunities for characters to gain skill levels, characteristic boosts and
            significant mustering out benefits before they enter into play. See
            <a href="character-creation.html">Chapter 1: Character Creation</a>
            for more information.
          </p>

          <h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
          <p>
            Skills represent training in a particular sort of task or knowledge, everything from
            acrobatic maneuvers to negotiation, piloting a starship, and programming a computer.
            Someone trained in athletics is able to climb faster and with more confidence than
            someone who isn't, for example. Skills are measured in levels, reflecting how much
            training a character has in the skill. When recording skills and their associated
            levels, the skill name is written first, followed by a hyphen, and then the number of
            levels that the character possesses in that skill. For example, Gambling-2 means that
            the character has two levels of Gambling skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each skill level represents roughly two years' worth of education and training in that
            skill. For skills of an academic bent, you could equate that to an Associate's Degree
            (or similar two-year academic program) at level one, a Bachelor's Degree (or other
            four-year program) at level two, a Master's Degree at level three, a Doctorate at level
            four, and so on. Skill levels act as a bonus on task resolutions rolls when a character
            attempts an action related to a skill. As your character follows their career, they gain
            skills. See <a href="skills.html">Chapter 2: Skills</a> for more information on specific
            skills.
          </p>

          <h2 id="game-play">Game Play</h2>
          <p>
            Playing a session using the Cepheus Engine rules resembles verbally acting out chapters
            from a science fiction novel. Game sessions can last from short sessions of an hour or
            two, up to marathon games covering most of a weekend. The average game session tends to
            run three to five hours, however. Over the course of a session, the player-characters
            pursue their adventures. Some resolve quickly, within a single session, while others may
            take place in multiple acts spread out over several sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each adventure is like its very own story, consisting of a series of scenes that are
            explored during play. In general, most scenes are simply the players interacting with
            the non-player characters and the universe created by the Referee. The players describe
            their actions, and the Referee describes the results of those actions, in a
            back-and-forth exchange. Certain kinds of situations, such as personal or space combat,
            have more structure and more rules to help the players resolve their actions in ways
            reflecting the abilities of their characters.
          </p>

          <h2>Common Cepheus Engine Themes</h2>
          <p>
            On-going games using the Cepheus Engine rules are generally designed around a theme.
            Based in the classic era of science fiction, these rules lend themselves to games
            following certain common themes, which are detailed in the Common Cepheus Engine Themes
            table. This is not a complete list of the type of games that the Cepheus Engine is
            designed to handle; this is simply a general list of common themes for consideration.

                has created. These campaigns are sometimes called "Sandbox Campaigns" because they
                explore an area that has been previously created and populated by the Referee.

          <h2 id="die-rolls">Die Rolls</h2>
          <p>
            Using the Cepheus Engine, when you have to make a die roll to resolve an action, it will
            typically follow the core system of a 2D6 roll plus modifiers versus a target of 8+
            (read as eight or higher). This is called a check. You always want to roll high on a
            check. Rolling 12 before adding modifiers (where two sixes appear on the dice naturally)
            is not an automatic success, and rolling 2 before adding modifiers (where both dice show
            a one naturally) is not an automatic failure.
          </p>

          <h3>Difficulty and Effect</h3>
          <p>
            A check's Difficulty is a number set by the Referee that modifies your check result.
            When no Difficulty is given, the assumed Difficulty is +0. So, for a task with a
            Difficulty of +2, you must add +2 to the check result. You succeed on a total of 8 or
            better. The list of Difficulty ratings can be found in the Task Difficulty table.

          <p>
            In some cases, the consequences of a check vary based on how much the check result is
            above or below the target of 8. The difference between the check result and the target
            of 8 is called the Effect. If the Effect is 6 or higher, the check is considered an
            Exceptional Success. When the Effect is -6 or lower, the check is considered an
            Exceptional Failure. See
            <a href="skills.html">Chapter 2: Skills</a> for more details.

          <h3 id="opposed-checks">Opposed Checks</h3>
          <p>
            If two characters are opposing each other directly in a task, then the character who
            obtains the highest Effect wins. For ties on opposed checks, the character with the
            highest relevant characteristic score wins. If the characters tie on characteristic
            scores, they reroll.
          </p>

          <h3>Trying Again</h3>
          <p>
            In general, you can try a check again if you fail, and keep trying indefinitely. Some
            tasks, however, have consequences for failure. For example, failing an Athletics check
            while climbing a cliff might mean you fall, which might make it difficult to try again.
            Some tasks can't be attempted again once a check has failed. For most tasks, once you've
            succeeded, additional successes are meaningless. (Once you've discovered a computer
            account's password using the Computer skill, for instance, there's no further benefit
            from additional Computer checks to determine the account's password.)
          </p>

          <h3>Circumstance Modifiers</h3>
          <p>
            Some circumstances make a check easier or harder, resulting in a bonus or penalty that
            is added to the check result. The Referee can alter the odds of success in two ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If a character has help, such as good tools, competent aids or other beneficial
              circumstances, he receives a +1 bonus to his skill check.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a character is hampered, such as having defective tools, incompetent assistance or
              other negative circumstances, he receives a -1 penalty to his skill check.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Time and Checks</h3>
          <p>
            Outside of stressful situations such as combat, performing a particular task often takes
            a random amount of time, depending on circumstances. For most tasks, roll 1D6 and
            multiply it by the increment that the Referee provides for that action. For example,
            breaking a flimsy wooden door down may only require 1D6 seconds, while performing
            delicate surgery might take 1D6 hours. More information on time increments can be found
            in
            <a href="skills.html">Chapter 2: Skills</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            During combat, most actions are more refined to a finite period. Some of these actions
            are considered minor actions, while others are deemed significant actions. More
            information is provided in
            <a href="personal-combat.html">Chapter 5: Personal Combat</a>.
          </p>

          <h3>Aiding Another</h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes characters work together and help each other out. In this case, one character
            (usually the one with the highest total of modifiers on the check) is considered the
            leader of the effort and makes the check normally, while each helper makes the same
            check. The Effect of a helper's check result can provide either a bonus (DM+1 with a
            successful result, DM+2 with an Exceptional Success) or a penalty (DM-1 with a failed
            result, DM-2 with an Exceptional Failure) to the leader's check result. In many cases,
            outside help isn't beneficial, or only a limited number of helpers can aid someone at
            once. The Referee limits aid as appropriate for the task and conditions.
          </p>

          <h2 id="types-of-checks">Types of Checks</h2>
          <p>There are two main types of checks: skill checks and characteristic checks.</p>

          <h3>Skill Checks</h3>
          <p>
            A skill check determines what you can accomplish with a particular skill (sometimes
            whether you're trained in that skill or not). It is a roll of 2D6, modified by your
            levels in the skill, the skill's key characteristic score modifier, and the Difficulty,
            against a target of 8 or higher. Skill checks sometimes have gradations of success and
            failure based on the Effect of your check result (how much higher or lower your check
            result is when compared to the target of 8). When making a skill check, if a character
            does not have any levels in the required skill, then he suffers a –3 penalty for being
            unskilled.
          </p>

          <h3>Attack Rolls</h3>
          <p>
            An attack roll determines whether or not you hit an opponent in combat. An attack roll
            is essentially a skill check, using your skill levels in combat skills as modifiers.
          </p>

          <h3>Characteristic Checks</h3>
          <p>
            A characteristic check is like a skill check, but measures raw ability, like strength,
            endurance, or intelligence. These checks are used when the task is one not covered by an
            obvious skill, or where the character's innate abilities are the most important
            influence on the result. To make a Characteristic check, you must roll 2D6 and add the
            appropriate characteristic score modifier. Characteristic checks tend to be all or
            nothing (you can either accomplish the task or you can't), although there are sometimes
            gradations of success or failure.
          </p>

          <h2 id="combat-round">The Combat Round</h2>
          <p>
            When things really start happening in a Cepheus Engine game, time is broken down into
            six-second segments called rounds, or combat rounds, since they're most often used in
            fights. A round isn't very much time, just long enough for a character to do something.
            The types of actions your character can perform during a round are significant actions,
            minor actions, extended actions, free actions, and reactions. During a round you can do
            one of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Initiate or continue an extended action.</li>
            <li>Take a significant action and a minor action.</li>
            <li>Take three minor actions, and forego taking a significant action this turn.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can perform as many free actions and reactions in a round as you wish, although the
            Referee may choose to limit them to a reasonable number to keep the game moving. See
            <a href="personal-combat.html">Chapter 5: Personal Combat</a> for more information.
          </p>

          <h2 id="pseudo-hexadecimal-notation">Pseudo-Hexadecimal Notation</h2>
          <p>
            The Cepheus Engine uses a form of pseudo-hexadecimal notation as a type of shorthand in
            noting specific values of characteristic scores, world statistics, drive type
            designations and similar design elements. The pseudohexadecimal notation proceeds as
            normal for values from 0 to 15, but extends beyond F for 15, with G for 16, etc. The
            Cepheus Engine skips the use of the letters I and O, because they might be mistaken for
            the numbers 1 and 0. The Pseudo-Hexadecimal Notation table provides a quick reference
            for converting values for use in Cepheus Engine.

          <p>
            The Cepheus Engine uses certain words and abbreviations throughout the rules system. In
            order properly understand the Cepheus Engine rules, both players and Referees should
            become familiar with these terms. The following words, phrases and abbreviations are
            commonly used in The Cepheus Engine:
