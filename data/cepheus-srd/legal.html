        <b><i>The following is an important notice:</i></b>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        This Product is derived from the Traveller System Reference Document and other Open Gaming
        Content made available by the Open Gaming License, and does not contain closed content from
        products published by either Mongoose Publishing or Far Future Enterprises. This Product is
        not affiliated with either Mongoose Publishing or Far Future Enterprises, and it makes no
        claim to or challenge to any trademarks held by either entity. The use of the Traveller
        System Reference Document does not convey the endorsement of this Product by either Mongoose
        Publishing or Far Future Enterprises as a product of either of their product lines.
      </p>

      <h2>Publishing Your Own Material</h2>
      <p>
        As you can see at the beginning of this System Reference Document, all of the text in this
        document is designated as Open Gaming Content, except for the titles of products published
        by Samardan Press, and the trademarks "Cepheus Engine" and "Samardan Press".
      </p>
      <p>
        This means you can copy whatever parts of the Cepheus Engine you want, add your own content,
        change the content around, and publish the result. Note that you will have to comply with
        the Open Gaming License, as reproduced at the end of this document. If you don't mention any
        of the trademark elements, you don't need to do anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, you can use the "Cepheus Engine" trademark, under certain circumstances, to
        indicate compatibility with this rules system. You have to follow the requirements of the
        Cepheus Engine Compatibility-Statement License (CSL), but if you do, you can state that your
        published material "is compatible with the rules of Cepheus Engine" or, "with the Cepheus
        Engine rules" or, "with the Cepheus Engine game." Here are those requirements:
      </p>

      <h3>The Cepheus Engine Compatibility-Statement License (CSL)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You must state on the first page where you mention Cepheus Engine that "Cepheus Engine and
          Samardan Press are the trademarks of Jason "Flynn" Kemp," and that you are not affiliated
          with Jason "Flynn" Kemp or Samardan Press™.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you're using the license to commit legal fraud, you forfeit the right to continue using
          the license: specifically, if you are claiming compatibility with the rules of Cepheus
          Engine, the claim must not constitute legal fraud, or fraud in the inducement, under the
          laws of the State of Texas. Note that this requirement is almost impossible to violate
          unintentionally—it's largely intended to keep me out of trouble, not to restrict
          legitimate statements of compatibility.
        </li>
        <li>You must comply with the terms of the OGL if the terms apply.</li>
        <li>
          Your cover must include the words "House Rules" or "Variant Rules" or "Alternate Cepheus
          Engine Universe" near the title if the document is a full, free-standing game that
          includes modifications. Feel free to contact the author if you wish to use a different
          form of disclaimer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Selling a full version of this game with your house rules incorporated into it is
          perfectly permissible, but you may not sell an effectively unchanged copy of the rules for
          money.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your document is a private house rules document, not being sold for profit or general
          use, you may scan and use artwork (including the cover) from the printed version,
          published in print under the title of
          <b><i>Cepheus Engine Core Rules</i></b
          >, provided that the cover contains the words "House Rules," near the title, and that the
          artists are appropriately credited.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your rights under this CSL cannot be revoked, and are perpetual, unless you breach the
          terms of the license, in which case your rights terminate.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you comply with the above, you may state that your resource is "for use with the
          Cepheus Engine Core Rules", "compatible with the core rules of Cepheus Engine" or "with
          the Cepheus Engine Core Rules."
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you have questions about the license, feel free to contact the author.</p>
