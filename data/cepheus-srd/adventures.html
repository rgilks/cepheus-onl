          <h1>Chapter 17: Adventures</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            Players in a Cepheus Engine universe are adventurers, plain and simple. They will seek
            out experiences and exploits, reveling in the thrill and excitement that comes from the
            pursuit of their goals. Cepheus Engine adventures encompass the potential for adventure
            that can be found in classic era science fiction. The opportunities are virtually
            limitless, restricted only by the circumstances of the scenario and the capabilities of
            the characters. The Referee generates and adjudicates encounters that make up the
            building blocks of these adventures. As the characters move from one adventure to the
            next, the stories create a campaign, set against a universe of the Referee's creation.
            Therein lays the core of a great roleplaying game experience.
          </p>

          <h2 id="conflict">Conflict</h2>
          <p>
            Stories are about conflict. Conflict doesn't have to be violent, but without a struggle
            of some kind, there is no story, and without a story, there is no true sense of
            adventure. The key to a great adventure is conflict. As a Referee, you should make sure
            you have conflict, and that the player characters are directly involved in that
            conflict. If there isn't any conflict, you lose the impetus for action. If the player
            characters aren't directly involved, they are just watching a story, which sounds more
            like a movie or a play than a roleplaying game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conflict doesn't have to be physical combat. It could just as easily be political or
            corporate intrigue, achieving a specific goal before the protagonist can either get
            there first or stop the characters from succeeding, handling courtly issues of a noble
            or legal nature, negotiating a diplomatic resolution to a larger conflict, and much
            more.
          </p>

          <h2 id="plot">The Plot</h2>
          <p>
            The plot of the adventure is essentially the synopsis of the events that will transpire
            over the course of the adventure. You should be able to sum up the plot of your
            adventure in one sentence. Knowing your plot before you begin creating the adventure
            provides focus and direction, and creates context for the scenes you will create for
            your adventure.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have problems in coming up with a plot for your adventure, you might look into
            Polti's "The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations." It's an extensive list of basic plots that
            you can use as the basis for your own stories and adventures.
          </p>

          <h2 id="epic-adventure-system">The EPIC Adventure System</h2>
          <p>
            The Epic Adventure System provides a way to design and organize adventures, that
            incorporates enough flexibility that the player characters have the 'freedom to roam'
            without causing the Referee nightmares. An Epic Adventure is broken down into 6 parts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cast of Characters</li>
            <li>Background</li>
            <li>Minor Scenes</li>
            <li>Plot Keys</li>
            <li>Chapters</li>
            <li>Adventure Checklist</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Cast of Characters</h3>
          <p>
            The Cast of Characters describes the major characters encountered in the course of the
            adventure.
          </p>

          <h3>The Background</h3>
          <p>
            The Background section provides the Referee with the background information necessary to
            properly run the adventure, and lays the groundwork for introducing this adventure to
            the players.
          </p>

          <h3>Minor Scenes</h3>
          <p>
            Minor Scenes (usually just referred to as 'Scenes') or just Scenes, are encounters or
            events that involve the player characters in some form. Many are directly related to the
            adventure, and may provide clues, equipment, or other information and materials needed
            to eventually complete the adventure. Others are merely to provide diversion and
            amusement. Scenes, unless noted in their descriptions, do not need to be played in any
            particular order, and may be sprung upon the player characters when the Referee deems
            appropriate.
          </p>

          <h3>Plot Keys</h3>
          <p>
            Plot Keys (or simply 'Keys') make up the heart of the storyline for the adventure. They
            contain vital pieces to the plot that must be played for the adventure to make any sense
            to the players in the end. You may play any number of Scenes before and after each Plot
            Keys, but all of the Plot Keys should eventually be completed in their proper order.
          </p>

          <h3>Chapters</h3>
          <p>
            A Chapter (or 'Act') is made up of one of more Plot Keys, and probably one or more
            Scenes. They outline the plot to the Referee, and provide tips and information for
            playing the Scenes and Plot Keys that are contained in the Chapter. In order to complete
            a Chapter, each Plot Key within must be completed. Each Chapter must be completed, and
            played in order to successfully run the adventure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of the 'cinematic' nature of an EPIC adventure, it is easy for the Referee to
            allow the player characters to temporarily deviate from the current adventure storyline
            to follow a false lead or pursue another short adventure that has interested them. When
            the player characters are ready to return to this adventure plot line, simply pick up
            with the next Scene.
          </p>

          <h3>Adventure Checklist</h3>
          <p>
            The Adventure Checklist provides the Referees with a recommended guideline of the order
            in which various Scenes and Plot Keys in this adventure should be presented to the
            players. As the characters complete each Scene or Plot Key, the Referee simply checks it
            off the list. When every Plot Key in a Chapter has been played, that Chapter has been
            completed and the Referee may begin the first Scene in the next Chapter.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will note that not every Minor Scene is included in the Checklist. This allows
            Referees who would like to use the Checklist, but would like to change things a little
            bit to swap out scenes, or include their own custom scenes. If you feel comfortable in
            letting your characters stray from the order of the Checklist, you may determine the
            'cinematic' order of the scenes as you see fit, or use a weekly events chart like the
            Example Weekly Event table to determine the course of events.
          </p>
          <p>
            This example weekly events chart has been created for an adventure in which the
            characters spend several weeks in the outback searching for lost ruins in the hope of
            finding historical artifacts.

            <dt>Starport Run</dt>
            <dd>
              This is an excuse and opportunity to bring in sideline encounters, patrons and
              scenarios unrelated to this adventure.
            </dd>
            <dt>Play a Plot Key</dt>
            <dd>
              Plot Keys should be plays in the correct order for the adventure to make sense to the
              players. If you change the order of the Plot Keys, you should be sure to adjust the
              other scenes to ensure that the adventure flows properly and makes sense.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h2 id="adventures-in-five-acts">Adventures in Five Acts</h2>
          <p>
            Many satisfying adventures have been inspired by the five-act structure of literary and
            dramatic creations. Made famous by Gustav Freytag's analysis of Shakespearean plays, the
            five-act structure lends itself well to basic adventures with only minor modifications.
          </p>
          <p>
            At its core, the five-act structure for adventures depends on five major scenes or Plot
            Keys: the Story Hook and Challenge, the Escalation, the Complication, the Climax and
            finally the Reward. Even though this structure is based on five Plot Keys, you can
            easily add or subtract as many minor scenes as the adventure you're creating calls for.
            Don't be afraid to deviate from this pattern as you become more comfortable with
            adventure creation.
          </p>

          <h3>The Story Hook</h3>
          <p>
            The key to the opening scene of any adventure is action. The story hook Plot Key should
            therefore be an action scene, involving either combat or some form of physical
            challenge. This draws the characters into the main conflict of the adventure's plot, and
            introduces the party to agents of the main antagonist. As this scene is wrapping up, you
            can either provide clues to the direction of the next Plot Key, or introduce a minor
            scene that ultimately points the party in the direction of the final climax of the
            adventure.
          </p>

          <h3>The Escalation</h3>
          <p>
            Now that you've met the needs of your more action-oriented players, you should create a
            series of roleplaying scenes or puzzle challenges that further escalate the plot,
            leading ultimately to a Plot Key that helps the players form a plan of attack for
            reaching the climax of the adventure. This allows non-combat characters an opportunity
            to shine. Investigation and information gathering make for excellent scenes in this
            regard. In addition, it provides the full roleplaying experience to the players,
            emphasizing why the group is playing a roleplaying game instead of a board game.
          </p>

          <h3>The Complication</h3>
          <p>
            Nothing is ever as straight-forward as it seems. The third major Plot Key introduces a
            complication to the party in fulfilling the needs of the plot. This Plot Key often
            requires the characters to expend resources, forcing them to decide on whether to spend
            their resources on this particular challenge or the big climactic challenge that is
            coming up next. In addition, this scene often introduces a plot twist or restriction
            that makes the resolution of this challenge and/or the climax that much harder.
          </p>

          <h3>The Climax</h3>
          <p>
            This Plot Key is the final showdown, the final fight with the primary antagonist of this
            story and his minions. This scene is most often a big fight or confrontation, but under
            the right circumstances, it could be a social or mental challenge instead. This is the
            big scene where everyone should have a chance to shine. It is suggested that this scene
            require a challenge more complex than "kill everyone", even if it's as simple as "kill
            everyone without any collateral damage to property or other persons". If the climax is a
            combat scene, the site for the climax should also include at least two different terrain
            features, to provide for some interesting situations that make such scenes memorable.
            While you don't want to overdo yourself, you also want to make this scene feel more
            exciting or important than the other scenes in the adventure.

          <h3>The Reward</h3>
          <p>
            This scene is the dénouement, where the plot is wrapped up and the characters receive
            their reward for their victory, or experience the consequences of their failure, on
            those occasions where things didn't necessarily work out. Often in Cepheus Engine
            adventures, the reward is monetary. However, characters might instead earn titles,
            receive ship shares, gain political support, earn some form of social advantage, recover
            lost or hidden information, or even learn a campaign secret that could change the face
            of the world forever. Sometimes, there's a final plot twist here, such as a secret
            guardian guarding the reward or a false reward serving as a distraction from the true
            reward of the adventure. If you have ideas for a future scenario you'd like to offer the
            players, you can even drop the first hints of things to come in the reward scene, giving
            the characters motivation to pursue the clues that may well lead to their next daring
            adventure.

          <h3>Other Suggestions</h3>
          <p>
            When creating your own adventures, keep things dense and concise. You will find that
            players have a knack for complicating things all by themselves, so don't feel a need to
            include a lot of false leads and irrelevant details. You can always improvise the
            additional of extra scenes as the need arises, but it is hard to work around a large
            number of required scenes if the adventurers suddenly take the adventure in a totally
            different direction.
          </p>

          <h2 id="three-dimensional-campaign">The Three-Dimensional Campaign</h2>
          <p>
            Unless you're running a "one-shot" adventure, put in the effort to keep your setting,
            plot and adventure three-dimensional. That is, even if your campaign has a very strong
            overarching plot, not everything has to be tied in it directly. For example, if your
            campaign revolves around a massive struggle between two interstellar polities, there
            should be some NPCs, sub-plots, protagonists and even organizations that don't work
            directly (if at all) for any side of the overarching conflict. Not every protagonist in
            your game has to serve the enemy government, and not all good guys have to get along
            together very well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for this, besides realism, is that both you and your players will eventually
            want to take a break from the main plot and do something else, especially during a long
            campaign. Sometimes you'll want, say, to steal a high-tech prototype, and that research
            facility belongs to a third interstellar government that remains outside the overarching
            conflict; sometimes you'll just want to explore an old, forgotten ruin uncovered in the
            wilderness of a backwater planet, a place unrelated to the main plot. Besides, making
            two factions work together against a common enemy despite hating each other with a
            passion could be a cool adventure, and so could be playing one opposing faction against
            another without getting caught.
          </p>

          <h3>The Rule of Three</h3>
          <p>
            As a general rule of a thumb when creating background elements involved in conflicts,
            such as organizations, factions, political figures, etc., you will best be served by
            creating three of them. For example, when you're designing a power struggle in an
            interstellar government, you should probably have three factions. The typical war can be
            created with three opposing sides, even if one of them is simply a large band of pirates
            with goals at odds with the two "official" sides. Creating three elements vying for the
            same goal creates a greater degree of dynamic complexity, allowing for adventures that
            explore the different relationships between the three elements without reducing the
            conflict to a simple "black-and-white", two-dimensional confrontation. Three sides give
            you plenty of opportunity to explore shifting alliances, subversive practices,
            negotiations, alternate paths to personal success and greater variety in your scenarios.
