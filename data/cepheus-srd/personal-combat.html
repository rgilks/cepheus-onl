            Personal combat is a common means of resolving conflicts. This chapter provides detailed
            rules for personal combat.
          </p>

          <h2>Personal Combat Checklist</h2>
          <p>
            Personal combat in the Cepheus Engine is cyclical. Everybody acts in turn in a regular
            cycle called a round. Generally, combat runs in the following way:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The Referee determines which characters are aware of their opponents at the start of
              the battle. If some but not all combatants are aware of their opponents, the
              combatants that are aware of their opponents are considered to get an automatic 12 on
              their initiative roll, giving them an Initiative of 12 + Dexterity DM.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any remaining combatants roll initiative. All combatants are now ready to begin their
              first round of combat.
            </li>
            <li>Combatants act in initiative order.</li>
            <li>
              When everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the highest initiative total acts
              again, and steps 4 and 5 repeat until combat ends.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="range">Range</h2>
          <p>
            Personal combat is divided into a series of range bands. These are identified in the
            Personal Combat Range Bands table.

          <h3 id="starting-range">Starting Range</h3>
          <p>
            When a combat begins, the Referee must decide the starting range that separates the
            groups of combatants. For combat in tight quarters, such as inside an office complex or
            starship, or within an underground tunnel system, the starting range is usually Short.
            The range for outdoor encounters is usually Medium, although open areas such as
            prairies, deserts, open roads and ocean surfaces make it easier to see at a distance, so
            Long or even Very Long range would not be inappropriate. Total darkness reduces starting
            range to Short or less. Partial darkness restricts starting range to Medium or less.
          </p>

          <h2 id="initiative">Initiative</h2>
          <p>
            If the combatants are all unprepared for combat, then each rolls 2D6 and adds their
            Dexterity DM to determine starting Initiative. Initiative determines the order that
            characters act in, but it can also be spent to react to events. If some of the
            combatants are ready for combat and some are not, such as in an ambush, the prepared
            characters are considered to get an automatic 12 on their roll, giving them an
            Initiative of 12 + Dexterity DM. Characters that are aware of a group, and that group is
            unaware of them, may elect to avoid conflict entirely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Characters that have the
            <a href="skills.html#tactics">Tactics</a> skill may make a
            <a href="skills.html#tactics">Tactics</a> check and add the Effect of this check to the
            Initiative of everyone in their unit with whom they are in direct communication.
          </p>

          <h2 id="combat-round">The Combat Round</h2>
          <p>
            Each combat round lasts around six seconds of game time. In a combat round each
            character gets a minor action and a significant action. Actions are taken in descending
            order of Initiative. If two characters have the same Initiative, the character with the
            highest Dexterity goes first. If they are still tied, then characters act
            simultaneously. When a character acts, he takes all his actions at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once everyone has acted a combat round is over and a new round begins. Initiative is not
            re-rolled but is dynamic, and may be adjusted up and down by actions taken during a
            round.
          </p>

          <h3 id="dynamic-initiative">Dynamic Initiative</h3>
          <p>
            During the course of a round a character's Initiative score may be changed by reactions
            and hastening. Any changes affect your Initiative for one round only – either the
            current round if you have yet to act or the following round if you have acted already.
            Reactions reduce your Initiative in order to allow you to defend yourself from attacks.
            Hastening your action lets you act sooner but at a penalty to your roll.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the start of each combat round a character may declare that he is acting hastily.
            This gives him a +2 bonus to his Initiative for that round only but all his actions
            receive a –1 DM. A character can only hasten once.
          </p>

          <h2 id="minor-actions">Minor Actions</h2>
          <p>
            Minor actions are actions intended to move a distance or to manipulate or move an
            object. You can take up to three minor actions per round, at the loss of a significant
            action.
          </p>

          <h3 id="aiming">Aiming</h3>
          <p>
            A character that spends a minor action aiming at a target gets a +1 DM to his next
            attack on the target, as long as the character does nothing except aim until he makes
            his attack. A character may spend multiple actions on aiming, gaining a maximum aiming
            DM of +6 if he spends six minor actions on aiming.
          </p>

          <h3 id="aiming-for-the-kill">Aiming for the Kill</h3>
          <p>
            Specifically aiming for a kill works exactly like regular Aiming, but does not add to
            the character's DM to hit the target. Instead, the character gains a bonus of +2 to his
            damage equal to the number of minor actions he spends Aiming for the Kill. He cannot
            dodge, duck, or move while aiming. He also loses his Aim bonus if hit or distracted. The
            maximum bonus obtainable from Aiming for the Kill is +6.
          </p>

          <h3 id="changing-stance">Changing Stance</h3>
          <p>
            A character can change to any one of the three stances – prone, crouched or standing –
            as a minor action.
          </p>

          <h3 id="drawing-and-reloading">Drawing and Reloading</h3>
          <p>
            The time taken to draw a weapon depends on its size and ease of use. The number of minor
            actions to ready or reload a weapon is listed in the description of each weapon. Most
            weapons take one minor action to draw and another minor action to reload, but some
            weapons are especially fast or slow.
          </p>

          <h3 id="movement">Movement</h3>
          <p>
            The character moves up to six meters. When using a square grid for modelling the combat,
            each square should measure 1.5 meters to the side. This means that the average character
            moves four squares on his turn. Difficult terrain, such as rubble, mud or thick
            under-brush can halve a character's movement, allowing him to move only three meters per
            movement action. Crouching also halves movement.
          </p>

          <h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
          <p>
            The Referee may permit a character to perform a skill check or other action as a minor
            action if the use of the skill does not require the character's full attention or
            complex physical actions.
          </p>

          <h2 id="significant-actions">Significant Actions</h2>
          <p>
            Significant actions are intended to do something within about 3 seconds. You can perform
            a single significant action per round, or forego it to perform a total of three minor
            actions.
          </p>

          <h3>Minor Actions</h3>
          <p>A character can take two minor actions instead of a significant action.</p>

          <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
          <p>
            A character may make a skill check or do something else as a significant action when
            such an action requires the character's full attention, concentration, complicated
            physical actions or some combination thereof. Any skill check with a time interval of
            1-6 seconds is simply considered a significant action during combat.
          </p>

          <h3 id="attack">Attack</h3>
          <p>
            The most common significant action is an attack. The basic attack action is trying to
            injure a foe with a melee attack or a ranged weapon. The attacker declares his target,
            and the foe may choose to react. The attacker then makes a skill check, and if
            successful, deals damage to his target. The actual Difficulty of this skill check is
            determined using the weapon type and the range of the attack, as given earlier in this
            chapter under Range.
          </p>
          <p>The standard skill checks used in making an attack are:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Melee Attack</dt>
            <dd>
              2D6 + appropriate melee combat skill + Strength or Dexterity DM (attacker's choice)
            </dd>
            <dt>Shooting Attack</dt>
            <dd>2D6 + appropriate gun combat skill + Dexterity DM</dd>
            <dt>Thrown Attack</dt>
            <dd>2D6 + Athletics + Dexterity DM</dd>

          <h3 id="coup-de-grace">Coup de Grace</h3>
          <p>
            A character can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless opponent
            that is within close range. They can also use a ranged weapon to do so, provided they
            are adjacent to the target. The attack automatically hit and the opponent dies.
          </p>

          <h2 id="reactions">Reactions</h2>
          <p>
            Reactions are actions taken immediately in response to the action of another. The more
            time a character spends reacting, the longer it will be until he acts himself. Each
            reaction lowers Initiative by 2 and applies a –1 DM to all skill checks until the
            following round. There is no limit to how many times a character can react in a round
            but a character can only react once to each attack and the penalties from reacting are
            cumulative.
          </p>
          <p>A character can only react to attacks that he is aware of.</p>

          <h3 id="dodging">Dodging</h3>
          <p>
            A character who is being attacked may dodge, giving his attacker a –1 DM and giving
            himself a –1 DM on all skill checks until the next round. If the character is in cover
            or has an obstruction to duck or dodge behind, the DM to hit him is increased to –2.
          </p>

          <h3 id="parrying">Parrying</h3>
          <p>
            A character who is being attacked in melee can parry, applying his Melee skill as a
            negative DM equal to the attack roll. A parrying character also has a –1 DM on all skill
            checks until the next round.
          </p>

          <h2 id="other-actions">Other Actions</h2>
          <p>Other types of action can take place during personal combat.</p>

          <h3 id="free-actions">Free Actions</h3>
          <p>
            Some actions are so fast they do not even qualify as a minor action – shouting a
            warning, pushing a button, checking your watch, and so on. A character can perform as
            many of these free actions as he likes in a turn, although if he performs several the
            Referee may require him to spend a minor or even a significant action on his various
            tasks.
          </p>

          <h3 id="extended-actions">Extended Actions</h3>
          <p>
            Some skill checks will take longer than a single combat round to complete. Make a Timing
            roll for the task and then work out how many six second combat rounds it will take to
            complete. A character engaging in an extended action cannot do anything else but can
            abandon their action at any time and return to the normal Initiative order. A character
            who is hit by an attack while undertaking an extended action must make an 8+ roll using
            the skill in question with a negative DM equal to the amount of damage the attack causes
            (after armor). Failure indicates that this round's work does not count towards the
            completion of the task. Failure by six or more (an Exceptional Failure) ruins the task
            and the character must start again.
          </p>

          <h3 id="delay">Delay</h3>
          <p>
            A character does not have to act when his turn comes up in the Initiative order. He may
            act at any later point during the round, even interrupting another's actions to do so.
            When he acts, his Initiative is set to the count on which he acted. If the character has
            not acted by the end of the round he may choose to act first in the next round,
            effectively giving up his actions in the previous round in exchange for an Initiative
            advantage. His new Initiative is set to one higher than that of the current first person
            in the order. When multiple characters are delaying and all wish to act first in the
            following round, their Initiatives are all set to the same score and they act in
            Dexterity order as normal.
          </p>

          <h2 id="special-considerations">Special Considerations</h2>
          <p>The following are special considerations in Personal Combat.</p>

          <h3 id="battlefield-comms">Battlefield Comms</h3>
          <p>
            Communications technology is a vital part of the battlefield. If a character is not in
            communication with the rest of his unit and his commander, then he cannot benefit from
            Tactics or Leadership. Characters that benefitted from Tactics at the start of combat
            and are later cut off from their commander have their Initiative lowered by the same
            amount it was boosted at the start of combat. Unlike other Initiative modifications,
            this lasts until combat ends or communication is re-established. There are several
            methods of communication:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Direct</dt>
            <dd>This covers hand signals and verbal communications.</dd>
            <dt>Hardlinks</dt>
            <dd>Hardlinks are wires or other physical connections, and cannot be jammed.</dd>
            <dt>Radio</dt>
            <dd>
              Radio communications allow communications as long as the radio signal can get through
              – they can be jammed or blocked by local conditions.
            </dd>
            <dt>Laser</dt>
            <dd>
              Two characters with tight beam lasers are in communication as long as line of sight
              exists between a character and another friendly laser-comm equipped character.
            </dd>
            <dt>Masers</dt>
            <dd>These work just like lasers, but can cut through smoke and aerosols.</dd>
            <dt>Meson</dt>
            <dd>
              Meson communicators cannot be jammed or blocked, but cannot be used while a character
              is moving.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h3 id="battlefield-conditions">Battlefield Conditions</h3>
          <p>Certain battlefield conditions affect ranged attacks:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Darkness</dt>
            <dd>
              Low light gives a –1 DM to ranged attacks. Complete darkness gives a –4 DM. Light
              penalties can be avoided by using sensors to target instead of the naked eye.
            </dd>
            <dt>Smoke or Fog</dt>
            <dd>
              Smoke gives a –1 DM to ranged attacks by obscuring the target; especially thick and
              impenetrable smoke gives a –2 DM. These penalties are doubled for laser weapons.
            </dd>
            <dt>Extreme Weather</dt>
            <dd>
              Driving wind, rain, snowstorms and so forth give a –1 DM to ranged attacks from poor
              visibility and a –1 DM to ranged attacks from environmental interference. Sensors can
              be used to avoid the visibility penalty.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h3 id="battlefield-sensors">Battlefield Sensors</h3>
          <p>There are several types of sensors.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Bioscanner</dt>
            <dd>Bioscanner 'sniffers' detect airborne pathogens and hazardous chemicals.</dd>
            <dt>Infra-Red (Heat)</dt>
            <dd>
              Infra-red sensors detect warm bodies, and negate concealment from smoke and soft
              cover, but can be jammed by strong heat sources.
            </dd>
            <dt>Densitometer</dt>
            <dd>
              An outgrowth of gravitic technology, a densitometer can scan an area and plot variable
              densities, effectively creating a three-dimensional map of all objects.
            </dd>
            <dt>Electromagnetic Detectors</dt>
            <dd>
              These sensors can detect unshielded high-power electrical devices, such as gauss
              weapons or transmitters.
            </dd>
            <dt>Laser-Assisted Targeting</dt>
            <dd>
              A low-powered laser is reflected off the target, giving targeting data to the firer.
            </dd>
            <dt>Light Intensification</dt>
            <dd>
              Light intensification technology magnifies visible light, negating the penalties for
              darkness or low light.
            </dd>
            <dt>Motion Sensors</dt>
            <dd>Can detect motion within range.</dd>
            <dt>Neural Activity Sensor (NAS)</dt>
            <dd>
              A combination of highly sensitive EM-detectors and psionic theory, NAS detectors pick
              up on the brain activity of living beings and classify them according to amount and
              complexity, giving a rough idea of the intelligence of subjects.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h3 id="blind-firing">Blind Firing</h3>
          <p>
            Blind firing works exactly like any other form of firing (including automatic), but it
            always treats the firer as having Level 0 in that weapon's relative skill. Additionally
            an extra die is thrown when firing, but before any calculations are made the highest die
            (or one of the highest, in case of a tie) is removed completely. Any successful
            attack(s) needs to then have a die rolled to randomly choose which eligible target in
            the firing line is hit – whether friend or foe.
          </p>

          <h3 id="burst-fire">Burst Fire</h3>
          <p>
            Weapons that fire a burst of 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, or 100 rounds may improve the attacker's
            odds of either hitting a target or inflict additional damage. The attacker must decide
            whether to spray the target, increasing the chances of scoring a hit, or to fire a
            precise, grouped burst in the hope of inflicting greater damage. Either sort of burst
            fire is considered a significant action.

            Any sort of low wall, undergrowth, convenient rocks or other objects can serve as cover.
            Attacks made on characters who are behind cover suffer the negative cover DM on the
            Cover Modifiers table below. Crouching or prone targets can claim cover one step higher
            on the table. If a character in full cover is crouching or prone they are impossible to
            hit but cannot return fire.

          <h3 id="explosions">Explosions</h3>
          <p>
            Grenades, rockets and other explosives affect an area. A character caught in an
            explosion may dodge at the usual Initiative cost. A character that dodges an explosion
            may reduce the damage by 1D6 if he just dodges or by half if he dives for cover. A
            character that dives for cover ends up prone and loses his next significant action.
          </p>

          <h3 id="extreme-range-firing">Extreme Range Firing</h3>
          <p>
            Any weapon that has the ability to fire into the Distant range band (including
            ranged(Rifle), ranged(Assault Weapon) and ranged(Rocket) attacks) can potentially strike
            targets even beyond, so long as the firer can see the target. Weapons fired at this
            extreme range do so using the modifiers for Distant range with an additional DM of –2.
            Only characters with at least three levels of skill in the weapon may fire at extreme
            range. To fire at extreme range, characters must be stationary and prepared to fire from
            some kind of rest (tripod, tree limb, bunker embrasure and so on). Vehicles must be
            stationary for weapons to be fired at extreme range from it. Energy-based weapons
            (lasers, PGMPs, and so on) inflict half damage (round up) at this extreme range.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be combined with
            <a href="personal-combat.html#aiming-for-the-kill">Aiming for the Kill</a>

          <h3 id="fighting-in-zero-gravity">Fighting in Zero Gravity</h3>
          <p>
            When fighting in zero gravity, a character's skill levels are limited to lower of the
            character's
            <a href="skills.html#zero-g">Zero-G</a> skill and the appropriate combat skill. For
            example, if a character has Laser Pistol-2 and Zero-G-1, then the character shoots with
            an effective skill level of 1, since his <a href="skills.html#zero-g">Zero-G</a> skill
            level is lower than his Laser Pistol skill level. Characters without
            <a href="skills.html#zero-g">Zero-G</a> skill are treated as unskilled in their attack,
            because of the disorientation. In addition, characters using weapons with recoil suffer
            a DM -2 on attack rolls when fighting in zero gravity conditions.
          </p>

          <h3 id="firing-into-combat">Firing into Combat</h3>
          <p>
            If a character is firing a weapon at a target that is at Personal range to another
            combatant, then the attack suffers a –2 DM. If the attack misses, roll 1D6. On a 4+, the
            attack hits the nearest other combatant to the original target.
          </p>

          <h3 id="grappling">Grappling</h3>
          <p>
            A character can attempt to wrestle or grab another person instead of hitting him. The
            attacker must move to Personal range and beat his target in an opposed
            <a href="skills.html#natural-weapons">Natural Weapons</a> skill check. If he wins, he
            may do any one of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Continue the grapple with no other effects.</li>
            <li>
              Disarm his opponent. If he succeeds by 6+ he can take the weapon away; otherwise it
              ends up on the floor.
            </li>
            <li>Drag his opponent up to three meters.</li>
            <li>Escape the grapple and move away (as if with a normal movement action).</li>
            <li>Inflict damage equal to 2 + the Effect.</li>
            <li>Knock his opponent prone.</li>
            <li>Throw his opponent up to three meters for 1D6 damage.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Throwing an opponent always ends the grapple. With any other option the winner can
            choose to end or continue the grapple as he sees fit. A character in a grapple cannot
            move nor do anything other than make opposed
            <a href="skills.html#natural-weapons">Natural Weapons</a> skill checks. Each time an
            opposed check is made the winner can choose an option from the above list.
          </p>

          <h3 id="panic-fire">Panic Fire</h3>
          <p>
            In order to call upon Panic Fire, a character must be using some form of small arms slug
            thrower. Panic fire uses all remaining rounds in the weapon, and hits are resolved as if
            the weapon were being fired using the Burst Fire rules for damage (not for accuracy).
            There is a DM –2 penalty to hit.
          </p>

          <h3 id="shotgun-spread">Shotgun Spread</h3>
          <p>
            Any shotgun loaded specifically with flechette rounds can be fired like a common round
            at a single target up to Short range, using the standard statistics for the weapon. If
            firing at a target or group of targets at Medium or Long range, the frag shell has its
            damage reduced to 2d6 but gains a DM+1 bonus to hit, and can hit not only the target
            aimed at but also anyone (friend or foe) in Personal range with the initial target.
          </p>

          <h3 id="suppression-fire">Suppression Fire</h3>
          <p>
            Suppression fire works by having the character actually target the areas surrounding the
            target; a wall, a tree or even the ground at their feet are all perfectly suitable. The
            impact of the character's attacks are often enough to give pause to a potential
            attacker. The firing character rolls his shooting attack as normal, except with a –2 DM
            for trying to hit cover and nearby objects to the target(s). This attack action also
            uses up double the normal amount of ammunition per attack. Failures are treated as
            normal misses. Success means that the firer has hit close enough to the target to force
            them to duck away, stalling their next action by adding an initiative penalty equal to
            the Effect of the attack. Suppressed targets also receive a DM-1 penalty to any skill
            checks that they try to perform in both the current and following combat round.
          </p>
          <p>
            Automatic fire can be used for Suppression fire, but no target can be affected twice by
            Suppression fire on the same action. The target must be allowed to take one action
            before he can be suppressed again. If multiple hits are used upon the same target, the
            highest Effect takes precedence.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are some situations and instances that can make a target so unshakeable that they
            do not care about Suppression fire, and will not be harried by it. Some of those
            exceptions are found on the list below.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vehicles, or targets fully enclosed in vehicles</li>
            <li>Zealots</li>
            <li>Mechanical or android targets</li>
            <li>Targets wearing full Battle Dress</li>
            <li>Suicidal targets</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="stance">Stance</h3>
          <p>A character can be standing, crouched or prone.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Standing</dt>
            <dd>A standing character uses the normal rules.</dd>
            <dt>Crouching</dt>
            <dd>
              A crouching character moves at half speed but can make better use of cover. If a
              crouching character is in cover, consider it one row lower on the Cover Modifiers
              table. For example, if a character is crouching behind a waist-high wall, he is
              considered to be at 3/4 cover rather than 1/2 cover.
            </dd>
            <dt>Prone</dt>
            <dd>
              A prone character cannot make melee attacks or dodge. He may make improved use of
              cover like a crouching character and he may still parry melee attacks. All ranged
              attacks targeting him suffer a –2 DM penalty. At Close range, the penalty is reduced
              to +0; a prone character being attacked at Personal range grants a +2 DM to attacks
              against him.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h3 id="tactics-and-leadership">Tactics and Leadership</h3>
          <p>
            The <a href="skills.html#tactics">Tactics</a> skill can be used to give an Initiative
            bonus to a whole unit at the start of combat. The unit commander may make a
            <a href="skills.html#tactics">Tactics</a> check, and everyone in the unit may increase
            their Initiative by the Effect of the check.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a href="skills.html#leadership">Leadership</a> skill can be used to increase
            another character's Initiative. The character with
            <a href="skills.html#leadership">Leadership</a> makes a
            <a href="skills.html#leadership">Leadership</a> check, and the target character's
            Initiative is increased by the Effect of the check. Making a
            <a href="skills.html#leadership">Leadership</a> skill check is a significant action.
          </p>

          <h3 id="thrown-weapons">Thrown Weapons</h3>
          <p>
            There are two kinds of thrown weapons: the first kind strike a single target and do
            damage from the force of their impact, such as throwing knives or a thrown rock. These
            use the normal rules for ranged combat. The other kind of thrown weapon is a grenade or
            other explosive projectile that inflicts no damage from impact but typically delivers a
            harmful payload. The first kind of thrown weapon adds the Effect of the Athletics check
            to its damage. The second does not.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the attack fails the projectile scatters in a random direction for (6 + Effect)
            meters. This is usually only important if the projectile explodes on or after impact.
          </p>

          <h2 id="damage">Damage</h2>
          <p>
            Each weapon lists the damage it inflicts as a number of D6. Add the Effect of the attack
            roll to this damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first time a character takes damage, it is applied to the target's Endurance. If a
            target is reduced to Endurance 0, then further damage is subtracted from the target's
            Strength or Dexterity (of the character's choice). If either Strength or Dexterity is
            reduced to 0, the character is unconscious and any further damage is subtracted from the
            remaining physical characteristic. If all three physical characteristics are reduced to
            0, the character is killed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a character has taken damage, any damage from subsequent attacks is allocated to
            any of the three physical characteristics as the character so chooses.

          <h3 id="armor">Armor</h3>
          <p>
            Armor reduces damage by the value of the armor. A hit with Effect 6+ always inflicts at
            least one point of damage, regardless of the target's armor.
          </p>

          <h3 id="fatigue">Fatigue</h3>
          <p>
            A character can become fatigued in numerous ways, such as staying awake too long,
            over-exerting themselves or even using certain medications. A fatigued character suffers
            a –2 DM to all checks until he rests. The amount of rest needed is 3 – the character's
            Endurance DM hours. If a character suffers fatigue while already fatigued they fall
            unconscious.
          </p>

          <h3 id="unconsciousness">Unconsciousness</h3>
          <p>
            An unconscious character may make an Endurance check after every minute of
            unconsciousness – if successful, he regains consciousness. If he fails he must wait
            another minute and can then try again with a +1 DM on the check for every check
            previously failed.
          </p>

          <h2 id="injury-and-recovery">Injury and Recovery</h2>
          <p>
            Injured characters are either wounded or seriously wounded. A character is considered
            seriously wounded if he has lost at least one point from all three of his physical
            characteristics. As soon as one of his physical characteristics is restored, no matter
            how, he is no longer seriously wounded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seriously wounded characters who have somehow avoided unconsciousness cannot move except
            to hobble or crawl along at 1.5 meters per combat round. They also lose their minor
            action in combat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wounded characters heal naturally and can also benefit from medical care. When
            characteristic points return from healing, players may choose which characteristic
            regains the points and may split healing between characteristics if they wish.
          </p>

          <h3 id="natural-healing">Natural Healing</h3>
          <p>
            An injured character regains a number of characteristic points equal to his 1D6 +
            Endurance DM per day of full rest. If the character continues an active lifestyle he
            only heals a number of characteristic points equal to 1 + Endurance DM per day.
            Characters with a low Endurance DM (quite possibly from injury) may degrade (lose more
            characteristic points) over time if they are unlucky or cannot (or will not) rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            A seriously wounded character only regains characteristic points equal to his Endurance
            DM per day of rest, which means that the character may never heal naturally and will
            even get worse if his Endurance DM is currently negative.
          </p>

          <h3 id="medical-treatment">Medical Treatment</h3>
          <p>
            Natural healing is not the only way to recover damage. Characters can also seek out
            medical treatment.

            <dt>First Aid</dt>
            <dd>
              Applying first aid restores a number of characteristic points equal to twice the
              Effect of the
              <a href="skills.html#medicine">Medicine</a> check. Points restored by first aid are
              divided as desired among all damaged physical characteristics. First aid must be
              applied within five minutes of the injuries being received to be fully effective. A
              character can still benefit from first aid up to an hour after their injury but they
              only receive a number of characteristic points equal to the Effect of the
              <a href="skills.html#medicine">Medicine</a> check. Performing first aid on yourself is
              a Difficult (–2) task.

            <dt>Surgery</dt>
            <dd>
              A character that is seriously wounded (after first aid has been applied) requires
              surgery. Surgery restores characteristic points just like first aid but if the check
              is failed the patient loses characteristic points equal to the Effect. Surgery
              requires a hospital or sickbay. Once one characteristic is back to its maximum level
              the patient can benefit from medical care. Surgery does not benefit characters that
              are not seriously wounded. Performing surgery on yourself is a Very Difficult (–4)
              task.

              <a href="skills.html#medicine">Medicine</a> skill in characteristic points per day,
              divided evenly among all damaged characteristics. Medical care requires a hospital or

            Other than Psionic Strength, characters may also suffer damage to their Intelligence or

            <li>
              Unlike people, who are mobile and maneuverable, careful track must be kept of which
              way a vehicle is facing. Vehicle-mounted weapons – and armed passengers, to a lesser
              extent – are restricted to certain fire arcs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Vehicles are considered to move on the driver's Initiative. The driver must spend a
              minor action every round to keep control of the vehicle under normal circumstances – a
              straight road or simple maneuvers – or a significant action to navigate obstacles,
              conduct evasion or pursuit, or dodge incoming fire.

            <li>Attackers gain a +1 DM to hit most vehicles because of their size.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="closed-and-open-vehicles">Closed and Open Vehicles</h3>
          <p>There are two main types of vehicles: open and closed.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Closed Vehicles</dt>
            <dd>
              Closed vehicles grant cover to the occupants – unless the description mentions
              otherwise civilian vehicles grant ½ soft cover and military vehicles full hard cover.
              Only a few people in a closed vehicle can shoot out, depending on the number of
              windows or other firing ports and the internal space available. Unless the description
              mentions otherwise up to two people can fire into each arc from a civilian vehicle and
              one person in each arc in a military one.
            </dd>
            <dt>Open Vehicles</dt>
            <dd>
              Open vehicles grant no cover to the passengers. Any passenger in an open vehicle can
              shoot (or otherwise attack) in any direction.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h3 id="vehicle-mounted-weapons">Vehicle-Mounted Weapons</h3>
          <p>
            Weapons mounted on vehicles are limited in what directions they can fire. A weapon
            mounted in the front arc, for example, can only fire into a 90° area in front of the
            vehicle. Weapons in turrets can fire in any direction.
          </p>

          <h3 id="collisions">Collisions</h3>
          <p>
            When a vehicle collides with something else everything takes damage. Roll 1D6 for every
            10 kph of the vehicle's speed (round up). This is applied as damage directly to anything
            hit and, if the thing struck is solid enough, also to the ramming vehicle. Any unsecured
            passengers in a vehicle damaged in a collision take the same damage and, if possible,
            are thrown three meters for every 10 kph of speed. Secured passengers (those wearing
            seatbelts or something similar) are not thrown anywhere and take one quarter damage.
          </p>

          <h3 id="vehicular-actions">Vehicular Actions</h3>
          <p>
            These are all significant actions that the driver of a vehicle can take when his turn in
            the initiative order arrives.
          </p>

          <h4>Evasive Action</h4>
          <p>
            Vehicles are not typically maneuverable enough to dodge as a reaction. Instead, the
            driver may declare that he is taking evasive action when his turn arrives. He makes a
            skill check (skill determined by vehicle) and the Effect acts as a –DM to all attacks
            against the vehicle or its passengers. The Effect also acts as a –DM to any attacks made
            from the vehicle as well. This lasts until the driver's next action.
          </p>

          <h4>Maneuvering</h4>
          <p>
            A driver or pilot can maneuver his vehicle without making a skill check. This allows the
            vehicle to avoid large or obvious obstacles, to get where it is going, to move out of
            one fire arc of an enemy vehicle and into a different one, or to change the fire arc
            that a single target is in.
          </p>

          <h4>Ram</h4>
          <p>
            Deliberately driving a vehicle into someone or something requires a significant action
            and a successful skill check (skill determined by vehicle). Rams are affected by dodging
            and evasive action as normal. The Referee may grant bonuses to a ram attempt or declare
            it automatically successful if the target is particularly large.
          </p>

          <h4>Stunt</h4>
          <p>
            With a significant action and a successful vehicle control check the driver or pilot of
            a vehicle can do pretty much anything it is possible to do in his vehicle – stand a car
            up on two wheels, perform stunning aerobatics in a jet plane, or skim a speedboat over a
            low sandbar. A stunt can be used to put a single target into one additional fire arc for
            one round, to set up some other skill check using the rules for task chains, to achieve
            something that would normally be difficult or impossible in your vehicle, to achieve up
            to three maneuver actions in one go, just to show off, or anything else you can imagine.
          </p>

          <h4>Weave</h4>
          <p>
            In an environment with many obstacles, such as an inner city or tight underground
            caverns, a driver or pilot may choose to weave his vehicle in and around the obstacles
            at high speed in order to evade pursuit. The driver chooses a weaving number, as low as
            one or as high as one per 20 km/h of speed (round up), and must then make a skill check
            (skill determined by vehicle) with the weaving number as a penalty on his roll. If he
            fails, he has woven into an obstacle and crashed. If he succeeds, any pursuers must
            choose a weave action on their turn and make their skill test at the same penalty with
            the same consequence for failure. Alternatively, they can choose to break off pursuit
            and either give up or try to reacquire the target later.
          </p>

          <h3 id="vehicle-damage">Vehicle Damage</h3>
          <p>
            Vehicles have a Hull value and a Structure value, which measure the vehicle's structural
            integrity. When Hull is reduced to 0, the vehicle starts taking damage to its internal
            systems. When Structure is reduced to 0, the vehicle is reduced to scrap. Vehicles also
            suffer damage to onboard systems as they take damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine the effects of an attack on a vehicle, first determine how much damage the
            vehicle suffers as normal. Many vehicles will have one or more points of armor that
            reduces the damage. Consult the Vehicle Damage table to determine how many 'hits' the
            vehicle suffers. Each hit is then applied to a particular location on the vehicle.
            Double or Triple hits count as two or three hits on the same location.

          <h4>Hull</h4>
          <p>
            Reduce the vehicle or drone's Hull by one. If a vehicle runs out of Hull, further Hull
            hits become hits on the same row of the Internal Damage table (if a vehicle) or
            Structure hits (if a robot or drone).
          </p>

          <h4>Structure</h4>
          <p>
            Reduce the vehicle or drone's Structure by one. If a vehicle runs out of Structure, it
            is destroyed. If the vehicle is destroyed by an attack that reduces it to a negative
            Structure score it explodes, doing 4D6 damage to everyone within six meters (including
            the occupants) and 2D6 damage to everyone within twelve meters. The occupants of a
            closed vehicle cannot dodge or dive for cover from this explosion but the occupants of
            an open vehicle can.

          <h3>Repairs</h3>
          <p>
            Damage to a vehicle or drone falls into three categories – System Damage, Hull Damage,
            and Structure Damage.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>System Damage</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                A damaged system can be jury-rigged back to functioning, but it will stop
                functioning again after 1D6 hours. Repairing a damaged system requires not only an
                Average skill check (using the appropriate skill as determined by the Referee, such
                as
                <a href="skills.html#electronics">Electronics</a>,

                <a href="skills.html#mechanics">Mechanics</a>) taking 1–6 hours but also a source of
                spare parts. The spare parts can come from a scrap yard, a workshop, systems on
                another vehicle, or can be taken from other systems on the same vehicle. When taking
                spare parts from other vehicle systems, each 'hit' of damage provides enough spare
                parts to make a single repair check.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Passengers and Cockpit systems cannot take hits to provide spare parts, although
                cybernetic parts might be able to provide enough spare material to repair minor
                damage.

                A destroyed system costs 2D6x10% of its original cost to repair, and cannot be
                repaired using spare parts. It requires a full workshop and specialist materials.

              Hull damage can be repaired with a
              <a href="skills.html#mechanics">Mechanics</a> check taking 1–6 hours and consumes one
              'hit' of spare parts.

            <dd>
              Structure damage can only be repaired in a workshop and requires 10–60 hours per point
              of damage. It costs 20% of the base cost of the vehicle per point repaired. No skill
              check is required.

            Ground Force Weaponry against Starship-scale Targets
          </h2>
          <p>
            Gaining a DM +4 bonus to hit anything on the starship-scale, ground force weaponry must
            divide its damage by 50 before comparing it to a starship-scale target's armor. Because
            a single weapon will, obviously, be unable to punch though armor it is possible for
            multiple weapons to all target the starship simultaneously, and the cumulative effect
            can inflict damage. Every additional ground weapon beyond the first can add half its
            damage dice to the total before dividing the total by 50 in order to calculate damage.
