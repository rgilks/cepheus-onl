          <h1>Chapter 8: Ship Design and Construction</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            Space ships are the backbone of any starfaring campaign. This chapter provides rules for
            the design and construction of such vessels for use in Cepheus Engine campaigns. Any
            class A starport has a shipyard which can build any kind of ship, including a starship
            with Jump drives; any class B starport can build small craft and ships which do not have
            Jump drives.
          </p>

          <h2>Standard Designs vs. New Designs</h2>
          <p>
            An interstellar economy provides an excellent opportunity for the use of standardized
            and modular designs. Components can be crafted on different worlds, taking advantage of
            available resources, and then put together to create a final product. Shipyards take
            advantage of modular components and standardized designs to reduce costs in production,
            which leads to a 10% discount on vessels constructed using common designs, such as those
            described in
            <a href="common-vessels.html">Chapter 9: Common Vessels</a>. The Referee may designate
            other ship designs as standard designs, as befits their universe. Fuel and weapon
            ammunition are not covered by the standard design discount.
          </p>
          <p>
            New and unique ship designs cannot take advantage of standardized and modular design.
            These ships must be designed by a naval architect, who creates detailed design plans
            based on a set of specifications provided by their client. Such plans take a month to
            create, and costs approximately 1% of the final cost of the vessel.
          </p>

          <h2 id="note-on-system-redundancy">A Note on System Redundancy</h2>
          <p>
            Ship systems take damage for a variety of reasons, becoming disabled or destroyed as
            damage accumulates. To counter the loss of vital ship systems, some ship designers
            install multiple versions of certain components. These redundant systems remain inactive
            until the original system is disabled, with the exception of ship weaponry. When all
            redundant systems have been disabled, any further damage begins to destroy them,
            beginning with the primary system.
          </p>

          <h2 id="displacement-tons">Displacement Tons</h2>
          <p>
            Hulls and other ship components are designated by their displacement volume.
            Displacement volume is measured in the volume of space that is displaced by one metric
            ton of hydrogen, referred to in this design sequence as displacement tons or simply
            tons.
          </p>
          <p>
            A metric ton of hydrogen measures approximately 13.5 cubic meters, which is rounded to
            14 cubic meters for ease of calculations. When drawing floor plans or maps of ships,
            each square measuring 1.5 meters by 1.5 meters, to a height of 3m up from the floor,
            represents half a ton.
          </p>

          <h2 id="ship-hull">Ship Hull</h2>
          <p>
            The ship's hull is the shell in which all other components are placed. A ship's
            construction time is based on its hull size, as outlined on the Ship Hull table.

          <h3 id="ship-configuration">Ship Configuration</h3>
          <p>
            A ship may have any of three configurations – standard (a wedge, cone, sphere or
            cylinder), streamlined (a wing, disc or other lifting body allowing it to enter the
            atmosphere easily) or distributed (made up of several sections, and incapable of
            entering an atmosphere or maintaining its shape under gravity).
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Standard</dt>
            <dd>
              A standard-hull ship may still enter atmosphere but is very ungainly and ponderous,
              capable only of making a controlled glide to the surface. Getting it back into space
              requires an elaborate launch setup and considerable expense. A standard-hull ship may
              have scoops for gathering fuel from a gas giant but the process will be much more
              difficult and less efficient. Larger ships of this type will often carry a specialized
              sub-craft to perform the actual atmospheric skimming.
            </dd>
            <dt>Streamlined</dt>
            <dd>
              Streamlining a ship increases the cost of the hull by 10%. This streamlining includes
              fuel scoops which allow the skimming of unrefined fuel from gas giants or the
              gathering of water from open lakes or oceans. Streamlining may not be retrofitted; it
              must be included at the time of construction.
            </dd>
            <dt>Distributed</dt>
            <dd>
              A distributed ship reduces the cost of its hull by 10%. It is completely
              non-aerodynamic and if it enters an atmosphere or strong gravity it will fall to the
              surface of the planet. It cannot mount fuel scoops.

          <h3 id="ship-armor">Ship Armor</h3>
          <p>
            Armor is added in 5% increments of the ship's tonnage. An armored ship decreases
            radiation exposure from space phenomena by 400 rads. (This does not apply to meson
            attacks and nuclear missiles, which bypass the armor or breach the hull to deliver their
            radiation hits.)

          <h3 id="ship-armor-options">Ship Armor Options</h3>
          <p>The following are options that can be added to a ship's armor.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Reflec (TL 10)</dt>
            <dd>
              Reflec coating on the hull increases the ship's armor against lasers by 3. Adding
              Reflec costs MCr0.1 per ton of hull and can only be added once.
            </dd>
            <dt>Self-Sealing (TL 9)</dt>
            <dd>
              A self-sealing hull automatically repairs minor breaches such as micrometeoroid
              impacts, and prevents hull hits from leading to explosive decompression. It costs
              MCr0.01 per ton of hull.
            </dd>
            <dt>Stealth (TL 11)</dt>
            <dd>
              A stealth coating absorbs radar and lidar beams, and also disguises heat emissions.
              This gives a –4 DM on any Comms rolls to detect or lock onto the ship. Adding Stealth
              costs MCr0.1 per ton of hull, and can only be added once.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h3 id="hull-and-structure">Hull and Structure</h3>
          <p>
            Initial damage is applied to the Hull; once the Hull is breached, further damage goes to
            the Structure. When all Structure Points have been lost, the ship has been smashed to
            pieces. A ship has one Hull Point per 50 tons of displacement (rounded down) and one
            Structure Point per 50 tons of displacement (rounded up).
          </p>

          <h2 id="ship-sections">Ship Sections</h2>
          <p>Most vessels are divided into two primary sections.</p>

          <h3>The Engineering Section</h3>
          <p>
            The Engineering section contains the drives and power plant necessary for proper
            operation and movement.
          </p>

          <h3>The Main Compartment</h3>
          <p>
            The ship's main compartment contains all non-drive features of the ship, including the
            bridge, ship's computer, the staterooms, the low passage berths, the cargo hold and
            other items.
          </p>

          <h2 id="ship-drives">Ship Drives</h2>
          <p>
            A non-starship must have a maneuver drive (M-Drive) and a power plant (P-Plant). A
            starship must have a Jump drive (J-Drive) and a power plant; a maneuver drive may also
            be installed, but is not required.

            For maneuver drives, the potential is the Thrust number (Tn), which is the number of Gs
            acceleration available. For Jump drives, the potential is the Jump number (Jn), or Jump
            range in parsecs. The power plant rating (A-Z) must be at least equal to either the
            maneuver drive or Jump drive rating, whichever is higher.
          </p>

          <h3 id="fuel">Fuel</h3>
          <p>
            Fuel needed for a Jump depends on the size of the ship and the length of the Jump and is
            calculated as 0.1 x Hull tonnage x Jump distance. A single Jump of that distance
            consumes that much fuel.
          </p>
          <p>
            The amount of fuel required by the power plant depends on the tonnage of the power plant
            itself, and is calculated as one-third of the power plant tonnage per week, rounded down
            to the nearest ton. Space-faring vessels require a minimum of two weeks' worth of fuel
            for the power plant. Deep space vessels may store four, six or even eight weeks of power
            plant fuel. For your convenience, the Power Plant Fuel Requirements table provides
            calculated values for both the fuel per week and minimum fuel volume by Drive Code.

            Ship computers run highly specialized software packages designed to support numerous
            functions, such as managing the Jump drive, evading incoming fire, controlling ship's
            weapons and executing automatic repairs. Ship's computers automatically provide the
            means for basic control of the vessel, as well as extensive library data on numerous
            topics and a basic level of security (Security/0).

          <p>
            Each stateroom is sufficient for one person, displaces 4 tons, and costs Cr500,000. No
            stateroom can contain more than two persons, such as for middle passengers, as it would
            strain the ship's life support equipment. The tonnage and cost of the staterooms

            A barracks takes up 2 tons per marine, and costs MCr0.1 per marine. Barracks can only be
            used to accommodate troops intended for boarding or assault operations. Troops
            accommodated in barracks cannot be used to reduce the number of service crew embarked.

          <h2 id="additional-ship-components">Additional Ship Components</h2>
          <p>
            The following are examples of additional ship components that might prove useful for
            certain ship designs.
          </p>

          <h3 id="armory">Armory</h3>
          <p>
            Ships carrying a large number of marines or soldiers can benefit from an armory, a
            specialized weapons store. An armory can only be accessed by those with the correct
            codes (usually the ship's senior officers and security team) and contains a wide variety
            of weapons. In game terms, an armory has enough snub pistols for the crew, enough
            accelerator or gauss rifles for any marines, and a selection of other military equipment
            like grenades, combat drug packs, combat armor and communications equipment. A general
            armory for a spacecraft costs MCr0.5 and takes up 2 tons of space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where military vessels are concerned, the number of armories built into the ship's
            design is based on crew size. One armory is installed for either every 50 crew members,
            or every 10 marines, in order to provide adequate storage for equipment, weapons and
            ammunition.
          </p>

          <h3 id="briefing-room">Briefing Room</h3>
          <p>
            A specialized briefing room is useful on mercenary cruisers and other adventuring ships,
            where teams can discuss plans or meet with clients privately. A briefing room gives a +1
            DM to Tactics checks made when planning missions on board ship. Ships with command
            bridges and fighter squadrons require additional briefing rooms and facilities. Capital
            ships must therefore have one briefing room per ship section, and one briefing room for
            every 20 fighter or bomber crew.
          </p>

          <h3 id="cargo-hold">Cargo Hold</h3>
          <p>
            The design plan must indicate cargo capacity. There is no cost but cargo carried may not
            exceed cargo capacity. Any space left over after all systems have been installed may be
            allocated to cargo space.
          </p>

          <h3 id="detention-cells">Detention Cells</h3>
          <p>
            Found primarily on military and government vessels, a detention cell is used to keep
            prisoners. A detention cell displaces 2 tons and costs MCr0.25.
          </p>

          <h3 id="fuel-scoops">Fuel Scoops</h3>
          <p>
            Fuel scoops allow an unstreamlined ship to gather unrefined fuel from a gas giant.
            Streamlined ships have fuel scoops built in. Adding scoops costs MCr1 and requires no
            tonnage.
          </p>

          <h3 id="fuel-processors">Fuel Processors</h3>
          <p>
            Fuel processors convert unrefined fuel into refined fuel. One ton of fuel processors can
            convert 20 tons of unrefined hydrogen into refined fuel per day. A ton of fuel
            processing equipment costs Cr50,000.
          </p>

          <h3 id="laboratory">Laboratory</h3>
          <p>
            Space allocated to laboratories can be used for research and experimentation. Each four
            tons of lab space allows for one scientist to perform research on board ship. The cost
            for research equipment varies depending on the type of research undertaken, but is
            generally around MCr1.0 per 4 tons.
          </p>

          <h3 id="launch-tubes">Launch Tubes</h3>
          <p>
            Launching and recovering small craft from a larger vessel is usually an activity taking
            30 minutes to launch or recovery one craft. Launch tubes allow small craft to be
            launched and recovered rapidly from a ship. The size of a launch tube is twenty–five
            times the tonnage of the largest craft that will be deployed in this manner, and they
            cost MCr0.5 per ton. With a launch tube, up to ten small craft can be launched per
            round. Multiple launch tubes can be installed.
          </p>

          <h3 id="library">Library</h3>
          <p>
            A library room contains computer files as well as lecterns, display screens, holotanks
            and even hard copies of books. A good library is useful for both research and passing
            time in jump space. Having a library on board a ship gives one extra week of training
            time for new skills per week spent in jump space. A library for a spacecraft costs MCr4
            and takes up 4 tons of space.

          <h3 id="luxuries">Luxuries</h3>
          <p>
            Luxuries cost Cr100,000 per ton, and make life on board ship more pleasant. Each ton of
            luxuries counts as one level of the Steward skill for the purposes of carrying
            passengers, and therefore allows a ship to carry middle and high passage passengers
            without carrying a trained steward on board.

          <h3 id="ships-locker">Ship's Locker</h3>
          <p>
            Every ship has a ship's locker. Typical equipment carried aboard will include protective
            clothing, vacc suits, weapons such as shotguns or pistols, ammunition, compasses and
            survival aids, and portable shelters. The contents of the locker are defined only when
            they need to be but always contains vacc suits and other useful items. The ship's locker
            is usually protected by a biometric lock keyed to the ship's officers.

          <h3 id="vault">Vault</h3>
          <p>
            A vault is a special armored chamber in the heart of a spacecraft, designed to survive
            attacks that would annihilate the rest of the ship. A vault has another four Hull and
            Structure points that only come into play when the ship housing the vault is destroyed.
            A vault can contain cargo, staterooms or any other internal components equivalent up to
            6 tons. A vault requires 12 tons of space and costs MCr6.

          <h3 id="vehicle-and-drone-hangar">Vehicle and Drone Hangar</h3>
          <p>
            The tonnage and cost outlined in the Hangar Cost and Tonnage for Vehicles and Drones
            table covers full-scale hangar space, which allows for repairs and maintenance of small
            craft when they are back on the ship. The hangar includes spare parts and specialized
            testing and repair equipment for the stored craft. It does not include the cost of the
            vehicles or drones. A custom hangar takes up tonnage equal to the tonnage of the vehicle
            to be stored, plus 30% and costs MCr0.2 per ton.

            <dd>
              Mining drones allow a ship to mine asteroids. Each set of mining drones takes up ten
              tons, and allows the ship to process 1D6x10 tons of asteroid per working day. The
              tonnage allocated includes ore handling machinery, allowing the ship to take on ore
              and transfer it to the cargo bay.
            </dd>
            <dt>Probe Drones</dt>
            <dd>
              Probe drones are for surveying planetary surfaces. Each ton of probe drones contains
              five drones. Probe drones can be dropped from orbit in disposable entry shells but
              must be recovered manually. Probe drones are also capable of surveying orbiting
              satellites, derelicts and other space debris. They can also be used as communications
              relays.
            </dd>
            <dt>Repair Drones</dt>
            <dd>
              Carrying repair drones allows a ship to make battlefield repairs with the AutoRepair
              software or when managed by a character with Mechanic or Engineer skills. Repair
              drones have the same statistics as repair robots only without an Intellect program.

            A ship has one hardpoint per 100 tons of ship and each weapon system takes up one
            hardpoint. A weapon system may include multiple weapons – for example, a triple turret
            contains three lasers, missile launchers, sandcasters or some combination of three
            weapons.
          </p>

          <h3 id="turrets">Turrets</h3>
          <p>
            One turret may be attached to each hardpoint on the ship. If a turret is installed, then
            one ton of space must be allocated to fire control systems:

              weapons cannot move, are limited to firing in one direction (normally straight ahead),

            designs using a universal ship description format, which is essentially a paragraph of
            text laid out in the following manner. Examples can be found in

          <h2 id="alternative-star-drives">Alternative Star Drives</h2>
          <p>
            In classic era science-fiction games such as the Cepheus Engine, the only form of
            faster-than-light movement is typically the Jump drive, which always takes one week to
            travel a number of parsecs equal to its Jump rating and consumes a vast amount of fuel.
            If the Referee wishes to model other science fiction settings with their own forms of
            "star drive", the classic Jump drive rules may not be entirely appropriate. The
            alternative drives below use all the same rules as the Jump drive (mass, fuel, power
            consumption, range) unless otherwise stated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of these drives consume much less fuel or allow much faster travel than the Jump
            drive, so introducing these drives will vastly impact the carrying capacity of a
            starship, the profitability of trade, the speed of communication and so forth.
          </p>

          <h3 id="warp-drive">Warp Drive</h3>
          <p>
            The ship warps space around it, allowing it to move faster-than-light while staying in
            our universe. A warp drive does not have a maximum range – instead, the ship's drive
            rating indicates the number of parsecs crossed per week of travel. Warp travel consumes
            fuel at twice the normal rate for the ship's power plant rather than needing a single
            massive expenditure in the manner of a Jump drive.
          </p>

          <h3 id="teleport-drive">Teleport Drive</h3>
          <p>
            The ship instantaneously jumps from one point to another. This works just like the
            standard Jump drive without the week-long wait in hyperspace. Instead, no time
            whatsoever elapses during the transition from one place to another. A teleport consumes
            no extra fuel but jumping is a strain on the ship's systems and multiple successive
            jumps can damage the drive.
          </p>

          <h3 id="hyperspace-drive">Hyperspace Drive</h3>
          <p>
            The portal drive functions by opening up a gateway into hyperspace, through which the
            ship can pass. When in hyperspace, the ship uses its conventional engines to travel,
            then opens up a second gateway back to the normal universe, effectively taking a short
            cut through a higher dimension. A hyperspace drive is limited by the size of the
            spacecraft that can pass through the portal – see the Hyperspace Portal Size table. A
            hyperspace drive consumes no extra fuel, but takes up twice as much space as a jump
            drive. While in hyperspace, the spacecraft moves at a rate of one parsec per day per
            maneuver drive rating.

          <h2 id="alternative-power-plants">Alternative Power Plants</h2>
          <p>
            The Cepheus Engine system posits the development of highly efficient fusion power
            plants, but other settings may use different sources of power. Unless otherwise noted,
            these power plants use all the same rules as the standard fusion power plants.

          <h3 id="fission-plants">Fission Plants</h3>
          <p>
            A fission plant requires radioactive elements as fuel. Fission drives only produce the
            same amount power as a fusion drive of the same type. However, they are twice the size
            and price of a fusion power plant. Fission plant fuel costs Cr1,000,000 per ton. Fission
            plants use the same amount of fuel in a year that standard fusion power plants require
            for two weeks.
          </p>

          <h3 id="antimatter-power-plants">Antimatter Power Plants</h3>
          <p>
            Antimatter power plants work by annihilating small amounts of hydrogen and
            anti-hydrogen. No tonnage needs to be allocated to fuel, but the plant must be refueled
            once per month, at a cost of Cr5,000 per ton of drive.

          <p>
            Small craft armor is purchased in the same manner as standard ship armor. However, small
            craft have a maximum armor value, based on type. Armor options may be purchased as per
            the standard ship design rules.

            A small craft must have a maneuver drive (M-Drive) and a power plant (P-Plant). The
            costs for each are captured in the Small Craft Drive Costs table. The performance of
            small craft drives are found in the Small Craft Drive Performance by Hull Volume table.

          <p>
            The fuel requirements for a small craft's power plant follow the standard ship design
            rules, except the values are rounded down to the nearest 0.1 of a ton, rather than the
            nearest ton. In addition, the minimum fuel volume for a small craft is one week rather
            than two weeks. For your convenience, the Small Craft Power Plant Fuel Requirements
            table provides calculated values for fuel per week by Drive Code.

            Small Craft Cockpits and Control Cabins
          </h3>
          <p>
            Small craft do not have bridges. Instead, a cockpit or control cabin serves the same
            function. A cockpit is more cramped, but takes up less tonnage. The cost for a cabin or
            cockpit is the same – MCr 0.1 per 20 tons of ship. Additional cabin space costs MCr 0.05
            per ton. Cockpits and control cabins come equipped with a basic communications, sensor
            and emissions-control electronics suite. More advanced systems can be installed per the
            standard ship design rules.

          <h3 id="airlock">Airlock</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike larger vessels, a small craft does not have an airlock by default. Airlocks take
            up one ton each and cost MCr0.2. If a craft does not have an airlock, then the crew
            cannot leave the craft except when it is landed or in a pressurized landing bay without
            opening the ship up to vacuum.
          </p>

          <h3 id="small-craft-crew">Small Craft Crew</h3>
          <p>
            All small craft of 50 tons or under require a minimum crew of one to operate and
            maintain the ship. Small craft larger than 50 tons require a minimum crew of two.
          </p>

          <h3 id="small-craft-armaments">Small Craft Armaments</h3>
          <p>
            A small craft has one hardpoint, despite being less than 100 tons. Small craft follow
            the standard ship design rules regarding armaments, with some exceptions.
          </p>
          <p>Meson, particle beam and fusion bays cannot be fitted.</p>
          <p>
            The armaments allowed to a small craft are restricted by its power plant type. It may
            only equip up to the number of lasers and particle weapons allowed by the vessel's power
            plant, as shown in the Maximum Energy Weapons by Power Plant table. The number of
            missile launchers or projectile weapons is not limited by the power plant letter.
